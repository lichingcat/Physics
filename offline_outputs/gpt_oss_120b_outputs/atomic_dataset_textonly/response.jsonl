Interaction between electron magnetic moment and proton magnetic moment leads to F=I+J coupling; J = electron angular momentum? For ground state L=0 so electronic total angular momentum is just S=½ => J=½. Proton I=½. So possible total F = 0 or 1. Energy shift proportional to A * [F(F+1)-I(I+1)-J(J+1)]/2 . Since A>0? Need sign determined by magnetic moments product. Electron g≈ -2, mu_B positive; proton g_p ≈ +5.585..., mu_N small but positive relative direction? Hyperfine Hamiltonian ~ (μ_0 / (4π)) (g_e μ_B)(g_p μ_N)/r^3 ... times dot product of spins with some factor leading to constant A >0? Actually measured hyperfine splitting gives lower-energy state being parallel alignment? In hydrogen 21 cm line corresponds transition between F=1 (higher) and F=0 (lower), frequency about 1420 MHz. Which one is higher? Ground-state hyperfine levels: F=1 has three sublevels slightly higher than F=0. So the triplet (parallel) is higher. Explanation via contact term: expectation value of δ(r) yields A ∝ |ψ(0)|² (positive). Then E_F = (A/2)[F(F+1)-I(I+1)-S(S+1)]. Plug numbers: I=S=½ → I(I+1)=¾ ; same for S. Compute:\n\nFor F=1: F(F+1)=2 -> E = (A/2)[2 - 0.75 -0.75] = (A/2)*(0.5) = A/4.\n\nFor F=0: F(F+1)=0 -> E = (A/2)[0 -0.75 -0.75]= (A/2)*(-1.5)= -3A/4.\n\nThus difference ΔE = A. If A>0 then F=1 higher. Determine sign of A: A = (16π/3) μ₀ g_e μ_B g_p μ_N |ψ(0)|² / ħ² ??? Let's compute sign: g_e=-2.002... negative, μ_B positive defined as eħ/(2m_e); g_p~5.586 positive, μ_N positive (eħ/(2 m_p)). Product g_e*g_p negative ⇒ A negative? But we have extra minus signs maybe due to definition of Hamiltonian H_hf = A I·J where A includes sign such that A>0 for hydrogen? Standard expression: H = A I·J, with A = (µ0/4π) (8π/3) γ_eγ_n ħ²|ψ(0)|² . Here γ_e = -ge µB/ħ , γ_n = gn µN/ħ . Their product is negative, thus A negative. However many textbooks define H = A I·J with A>0 meaning they absorb sign. Usually result: F=1 higher. We'll present reasoning using formula above showing sign leads to higher energy for aligned spins because electron magnetic moment opposite to its spin (negative gyromagnetic ratio). Therefore net magnetic dipole-dipole interaction results in repulsion when both spins align (since their magnetic moments anti-align?). Anyway produce explanation.\n\nPart b: Hydrogen molecule H₂ ground state: two protons each spin ½ combine to overall nuclear spin I_total = 0 (singlet, para-H2) or 1 (triplet, ortho-H2). Rotational wavefunction symmetry requires overall molecular wavefunction antisymmetric under exchange of identical fermions (protons). Electronic ground state Σ_g⁺ symmetric spatially, vibrational symmetric. Thus rotational part determines parity: even J correspond to symmetric rotation function, odd J antisymmetric. Combined with nuclear spin symmetry: symmetric spin (triplet) must pair with antisymmetric spatial (odd J) to make overall antisymmetry. Hence lowest allowed rotational quantum number for ortho (triplet) is J=1 giving rotational energy B*J(J+1) with B≈60 K (~7 meV). Para (singlet) can occupy J=0 (lowest rotational energy zero). At low temperature, para-H2 lower energy. So triplet higher due to required rotational excitation. From first principles: use Pauli principle and Born-Oppenheimer separation.\n\nProvide diagrams: atomic hyperfine: two levels labeled F=0 (para?) lower, F=1 upper triple degenerate.

Explain these facts.", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to address four subquestions:\n\na) Why heavy nuclei undergo alpha decay but not neutron emission; derive argument using binding energies per nucleon curve, Coulomb barrier etc., Q-values.\n\nb) Methods/arguments to determine nuclear radii: electron scattering, muonic atoms, isotope shift, charge distribution from elastic scattering, diffraction patterns, liquid drop model R=R_0 A^(1/3), systematic fits, hadron scattering, antiprotonic atom X-ray shifts, etc.\n\nc) Properties identifying ground-state nucleus: minimal total energy, zero angular momentum (J^π = 0+ for even-even), pairing effects, shell closures, saturation, short-range correlations, quantum nature like superfluid pairing, collective excitations suppressed, magic numbers, deformation, spin-orbit coupling, non-classical features such as quantized angular momentum, tunneling leading to alpha decay, entanglement among nucleons, exchange symmetry, Pauli principle, BCS-like Cooper pairs.\n\nd) Explanation of variation in thermal vs fast neutron induced fission cross-sections across U isotopes. Thermal neutrons have low kinetic energy (~0.025 eV). Capture leads to compound nucleus with excitation equal to neutron separation + capture energy. For certain isotopes, resulting compound nucleus may lie above fission barrier or not depending on parity/spin states, level density, odd-A vs even-A influences. Even–odd effect due to pairing reduces level density for even-even nuclei making resonance absorption lower/higher? Actually thermal fission cross-section high when there exists low-energy resonances near threshold; odd-N or odd-Z gives higher probability because unpaired nucleon provides more available s-wave capture states (no centrifugal barrier). So odd-mass isotopes show larger sigma. Also some isotopes have no bound excited states accessible -> zero cross section (e.g., ^234U, ^236U): they require extra energy beyond thermal to overcome fission barrier; their neutron separation energy plus incident energy insufficient to reach region where fission channel dominates; also maybe negative Q-value for n-induced fission (threshold >0). Fast neutrons give enough energy to surpass barriers regardless of pairing, so cross sections become similar.\n\nNeed to discuss even-odd staggering: Pairing gap ~Δ~12/sqrt(A); even-even nuclei have paired nucleons => higher binding thus smaller neutron-capture Q value? Actually capture forms compound nucleus one mass unit heavier; if original target is even-even, new nucleus becomes odd-A which has reduced binding (pair-breaking) causing lower neutron separation energy, hence exothermic reaction yields more excitation energy → easier fission. Conversely, starting from odd-A target results in even-even compound nucleus with higher binding, less excitation, possibly reducing fission probability. But observed opposite: odd targets have larger thermal fission cross sections—due to presence of low-lying s-wave resonances because incoming neutron can couple directly without needing orbital angular momentum barrier; even-even targets only allow p-wave capture at low E due to selection rules? Need nuance: In thermal regime, l=0 captures dominate; however for even-even target, Jπ of ground state is 0+, captured neutron adds ½ spin giving possible J=½− states requiring negative parity – requires l=1? Wait parity change: neutron intrinsic parity positive, overall parity = (-1)^l * (+). To get negative parity you need odd l. If initial 0+ and final compound needs ½+ perhaps allowed with l=0? Let's recall: Compound nucleus formed after capture inherits parity π_target × π_neutron × (-1)^l . Since neutron parity is +, parity = π_target*(-1)^l. For even-even target 0+, we want compound states of appropriate spin/parities present near threshold. Many levels of opposite parity might be absent at low excitation, suppressing s-wave capture. Odd-A target already has non-zero spin allowing many possibilities including matching parities with l=0. Hence enhanced s-wave capture cross-section.\n\nAlso mention statistical model: Level densities differ; odd-A have roughly twice the level density compared to neighboring even-even at given excitation, increasing probability of forming a state above fission barrier.\n\nNow craft detailed answers.\n\nWill include equations: Binding energy per nucleon curve, semi-empirical mass formula showing competition between volume term (∝A) and surface & coulomb terms; condition for spontaneous α-decay: Qα>0 i.e., M_parent - M_daughter - M_alpha >0 ; approximate via SEMF shows increase of Z/A ratio makes Qα positive for heavy nuclei while neutron emission would require Mn > ...

Capture then populates\n   **s‑wave resonances** of the compound nucleus \\((Z,A+1)\\). Whether a\n   particular resonance lies just above the fission barrier decides the\n   magnitude of the thermal fission cross section.\n\n2. **Even–odd (pairing) effect**  \n   • An **even‑even target** has ground‑state spin-parity \\(0^+\\).  \n     Adding an \\(l=0\\) neutron gives a compound state of parity\n     \\((-1)^l=+1\\) and spin \\(J=\\tfrac12\\).  However most low‑lying\n     \\(J^\\pi\\) levels of the neighbouring odd‑mass nucleus are of **negative\n     parity**, forcing the capture to proceed mainly through **p‑waves**\n     (\\(l=1\\)), whose penetrability at thermal energies is heavily\n     suppressed.  \n   • An **odd‑A target** possesses a non‑zero ground‑state spin (typically\n     \\(J=\\tfrac12\\) or \\(\\tfrac32\\)).  This allows numerous compatible\n     \\(J^\\pi\\) combinations for an \\(l=0\\) capture, producing strong\n     s‑wave resonances right at threshold. Consequently the thermal\n     fission cross sections of odd‑mass isotopes (^231U, ^233U, ^235U) are\n     markedly larger (hundreds of barns) than those of the adjacent even‑even ones.\n\n3. **Threshold behavior of ^234U and ^236U**  \n   For these even‑even isotopes the neutron‑capture Q‑value places the\n   compound nucleus **below** the fission saddle point; the excitation\n   supplied by a thermal neutron (< 100 meV) is insufficient to surmount\n   the barrier. Their fission thresholds are a few hundred keV, so the\n   thermal fission cross section is effectively **zero**.\n\n4. **Fast neutrons**  \n   With kinetic energies of MeV, the incident neutron brings ample\n   orbital angular momentum and supplies tens of MeV of additional\n   excitation. All compounds now sit comfortably **above** the fission\n   barrier irrespective of the fine details of the low‑lying level scheme.\n   Therefore the **even–odd staggering disappears** and the fission\n   probabilities converge to a common value of a few barns for all six\n   isotopes.\n\n5. **Summary of the observed pattern**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{Odd‑A target} &: \\text{s‑wave capture }\\Rightarrow\\text{large }\\sigma_f^{\\rm th}\\\\\n\\text{Even‑even target}&:\\text{mostly p‑wave capture }\\Rightarrow\\text{small }\n\\sigma_f^{\\rm th};\\; \\text{if }E_{\\rm thr}>kT\\; \\Rightarrow 0.\\\\[2pt]\n\\text{Fast neutrons}&:\\text{high }E_n\\Rightarrow\\text{all exceed }B_f\\;\n\\Rightarrow\\text{similar }\\sigma_f.\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThus the combination of **Coulomb‑plus‑surface barrier heights**, **pairing‑induced\nlevel‑density differences**, and the **orbital‑angular‑momentum selectivity**\nof ultra‑slow neutrons explains both the pronounced even–odd modulation of\nthermal‑fission cross sections and the relatively uniform, modest values seen\nwith fast neutrons.\n\n--- \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&(a)\\; \\text{Heavy nuclei have }Q_\\alpha>0\\text{ (Coulomb term wins)}\\;\n\\text{but }Q_n<0\\text{ (neutrons still bound).}\\\\\n&(b)\\; \\text{Electron/muon scattering, hadron scattering, isotope shifts,}\n\\\\\n&\\qquad\\text{antiprotonic atoms and the empirical }R=r_0A^{1/3}\\text{ law.}\\\\\n&(c)\\; \\text{Ground state = minimum energy, closed shells/pairing, }J^\\pi=0^+\n\\text{for even‑even, quantum tunnelling, entanglement, etc.}\\\\\n&(d)\\; \\text{Large thermal }σ_f\\text{ for odd‑A isotopes due to s‑wave resonances;}\n\\\\\n&\\qquad\\text{even‑even isotopes lack low‑lying s‑states, giving tiny or zero }\nσ_f^{\\rm th};\n\\\\\n&\\qquad\\text{at MeV energies all isotopes exceed the fission barrier, so }\nσ_f^{\\rm fast}\\sim\\text{few barn, weak even–odd effect.}\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\]"}
{"id": "atomic/1-12", "questions": "The electric field that an atom experiences from its surroundings within a molecule or crystal can noticeably affect properties of the atomic ground state. An interesting example has to do with the phenomenon of angular momentum quenching in the iron atom of the hem group in the hemoglobin of your blood. Iron and hemoglobin are too complicated, however. So consider an atom containing one valence electron moving in a central atomic potential. It is in an $l = 1$ level. Ignore spin. We ask what happens to this level when the electron is acted on by the external potential arising from \nthe atom's surroundings. Take this external potential to be\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{pert}} = Ax^2 + By^2 - (A + B)z^2\n$$\n\n(the atomic nucleus is at the origin of coordinates) and treat it to lowest \norder.\n\n(a) The $l = 1$ level now splits into three distinct levels.

For l=1 states (p orbitals). Basis functions proportional to x f(r), y f(r), z f(r). These correspond to p_x,p_y,p_z. Need matrix elements <i|V|j>. Since radial part same, integrals reduce to angular averages times ⟨r^2⟩ maybe. Write operator in spherical harmonics? Use Cartesian basis; evaluate matrix elements:\n\nLet |x> ≡ ψ_x = N x f(r); similarly y,z. Then matrix element ⟨x|V|y⟩ ∝ ⟨x|Ay^2+...|y⟩ etc. Because odd powers give zero due symmetry? Let's think: integral over angles of x * y^2 * y ... Actually bra includes x, ket includes y. So term like ⟨x| Ay^2 |y⟩ involves ∫ x* y^2 * y dΩ = ∫ x y^3 dΩ =0 because odd power in x yields zero. Similarly cross terms vanish. Diagonal elements: ⟨x|Ax^2|x⟩ gives A∫ x*x^2*x = A∫ x^3 ? Wait bra x, operator x^2, ket x => product x*(x^2)*x = x^4. Integral nonzero. Also contributions from other parts: e.g., ⟨x|By^2|x⟩ -> x*y^2*x = x^2 y^2 integrate not zero. And ⟨x|(−(A+B)z^2)|x⟩ -> −(A+B)x*z^2*x = −(A+B) x^2 z^2.\n\nThus Hamiltonian in subspace spanned by {|x>,|y>,|z>} is diagonal (no mixing) because off-diagonals vanish by parity/oddness. Therefore eigenstates are just those basis functions themselves. Energy shift ΔE_i = ⟨i|V|i⟩ / normalization.\n\nCompute integrals using average values over sphere: define I_n = ⟨x^{2n}⟩ etc. Using isotropy: ⟨x^2⟩ = ⟨y^2⟩ = ⟨z^2⟩ = r^2/3 averaged over angle. Likewise ⟨x^4⟩ = ?, use formula: Over unit sphere, ⟨x_i^2 x_j^2⟩ = r^4/(15) if i≠ j ; and ⟨x_i^4⟩ = r^4/5. Indeed for uniform direction distribution, moments: ⟨n_i n_j⟩ = δ_ij/3 ; ⟨n_i n_j n_k n_l⟩ = (δ_{ij}δ_{kl}+δ_{ik}δ_{jl}+δ_{il}δ_{jk})/15 . Multiply by r^4. Thus x^4 avg = r^4 * (3)/15?? Wait plug indices all equal i=j=k=l=x: then expression becomes (δ_{xx}δ_{xx}+δ_{xx}δ_{xx}+δ_{xx}δ_{xx})/15 = (1+1+1)/15 = 3/15 = 1/5. Good matches earlier.\n\nSimilarly x^2 y^2 avg corresponds to case i=j=x,k=l=y giving δ_{xy}=0 so only second term δ_{ik}δ_{jl}=δ_{xy}δ_{xy}=0, third term δ_{il}δ_{jk}=δ_{xy}δ_{xy}=0, first term δ_{ij}δ_{kl}=δ_{xx}δ_{yy}=1*1=1. So result 1/15. Good.\n\nNow compute expectation values including radial factor ⟨r^2⟩ and ⟨r^4⟩? Actually V contains quadratic coordinate squares multiplied by coefficient but no extra r dependence beyond squared coordinates. Expectation value uses wavefunction ψ_i ~ coord * f(r). Normalization constant ensures overall probability integrates to 1. We'll get factors involving ⟨r^2⟩ perhaps.\n\nLet's denote radial integral R = ∫_0^\\infty dr r^2 [f(r)]^2 r^2 ??? Wait wavefunction ψ_i = C_i * coordinate * f(r). Probability density ∝ coordinate^2 f(r)^2. To compute ⟨coordinate^4⟩ etc we need radial integral of r^4 f(r)^2 times angular average of directional components raised appropriate powers.\n\nNormalization condition: ∫ d³r (coord²) f(r)² =1. That implies C such that integrated over angles gives factor ⟨n_i^2⟩ =1/3. So choose normalized states accordingly. However since we're interested in ratios of energies among different m states, the radial integrals cancel out because they appear multiplicatively same for each component (since same combination of powers?). Let's verify: For ⟨x|V|x⟩ we have terms with ⟨x⁴⟩, ⟨x² y²⟩, ⟨x² z²⟩ each multiply same radial moment ⟨r⁴⟩ (because total power four). So overall shift = K * ⟨r⁴⟩ where K depends on coefficients A,B. Same for others. Hence relative shifts independent of radial details.\n\nSo compute K_x = A⟨x⁴⟩ + B⟨x² y²⟩ - (A+B)⟨x² z²⟩ .\n\nUsing values: ⟨x⁴⟩ = 1/5 , ⟨x² y²⟩ = ⟨x² z²⟩ = 1/15 .\n\nTherefore K_x = A*(1/5) + B*(1/15) - (A+B)*(1/15)\n\nSimplify: First combine B term minus (A+B): B/15 - (A+B)/15 = (B - A - B)/15 = (-A)/15 . So K_x = A/5 - A/15 = A*(1/5 - 1/15)= A*(3/15 -1/15)= A*(2/15)= (2A)/15.\n\nNice! So shift for p_x is proportional to A.\n\nSimilarly for p_y: K_y = A⟨y² x²⟩ + B⟨y⁴⟩ - (A+B)⟨y² z²⟩ . Here ⟨y² x²⟩ =1/15, ⟨y⁴⟩=1/5, ⟨y² z²⟩=1/15 . So K_y = A/15 + B/5 - (A+B)/15 = A/15 - A/15 cancels leaving B/5 - B/15 = B*(1/5 -1/15)= B*(2/15)= (2B)/15.\n\nFor p_z: K_z = A⟨z² x²⟩ + B⟨z² y²⟩ - (A+B)⟨z⁴⟩ . Both mixed terms =1/15. So K_z = A/15 + B/15 - (A+B)/5 . Combine numerator: (A+B)/15 - (A+B)/5 = (A+B)(1/15 - 1/5) = (A+B)(1/15 -3/15)=-(A+B)*(2/15)= -(2(A+B))/15.\n\nThus energy shifts ΔE_x = const * (2A)/15, ΔE_y = const *(2B)/15, ΔE_z = const *(-2(A+B))/15.\n\nCommon factor could be ⟨r⁴⟩ times some normalization factor; we can present relative shifts: ΔE_x : ΔE_y : ΔE_z = A : B : -(A+B).\n\nSketch: three lines split according to sign.\n\nPart b: expectation L_z for each eigenstate. In orbital basis, L_z acting on p_x and p_y mixes them: L_z = -iħ(x∂_y - y∂_x). On these real combinations, expectation may be zero individually? Evaluate ⟨p_x|L_z|p_x⟩ = 0 because operator changes parity? Since L_z is antisymmetric under exchange x↔y leading to imaginary. Real wavefunctions yield zero expectation. Similarly for p_y and p_z also zero? But check p_z: L_z acts on z f(r) which does not depend on φ, should give zero. So all expectations zero. However there might be linear combos corresponding to complex spherical harmonic Y₁±¹ having definite L_z = ± ħ. Our eigenstates are real cartesian ones, thus expectation zero. Problem likely expects that after splitting, the eigenvectors remain pure px, py, pz, hence ⟨L_z⟩ =0 for each. Unless degeneracy leads to new eigenstates being mixtures? Off-diagonal zero means eigenstates unchanged, indeed expectation zero.\n\nProvide explanation.\n\nWrite final answers boxed.\n\nassistantfinal**Perturbation**\n\n\\[\nV_{\\rm pert}=A\\,x^{2}+B\\,y^{2}-(A+B)\\,z^{2},\n\\qquad   H'=H_{0}+V_{\\rm pert}.\n\\]\n\nOnly the \\(l=1\\;(p)\\) manifold is considered.  \nIn the Cartesian basis  \n\n\\[\n|X\\rangle\\equiv \\psi_X(\\mathbf r)=N\\,x\\,f(r),\\quad   \n|Y\\rangle\\equiv N\\,y\\,f(r),\\quad    \n|Z\\rangle\\equiv N\\,z\\,f(r)\n\\]\n\nwith a common normalisation constant \\(N\\) and a common radial function\n\\(f(r)\\).\nBecause the un‑perturbed problem is spherically symmetric,\nall radial integrals appearing in the matrix elements are identical;\nonly the **angular** averages differ.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### (a) Splitting of the \\(l=1\\) level  \n\nMatrix elements inside the \\(|X,Y,Z\\rangle\\) space are\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\langle X|V|X\\rangle &=\nA\\!\\int x^{4}\\!d\\Omega+\nB\\!\\int x^{2}y^{2}\\!d\\Omega-\n(A+B)\\!\\int x^{2}z^{2}\\!d\\Omega ,\n\\\\[2mm]\n\\langle Y|V|Y\\rangle &= \nA\\!\\int y^{2}x^{2}\\!d\\Omega+\nB\\!\\int y^{4}\\!d\\Omega-\n(A+B)\\!\\int y^{2}z^{2}\\!d\\Omega ,\n\\\\[2mm]\n\\langle Z|V|Z\\rangle &=\nA\\!\\int z^{2}x^{2}\\!d\\Omega+\nB\\!\\int z^{2}y^{2}\\!d\\Omega-\n(A+B)\\!\\int z^{4}\\!d\\Omega .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nAll off–diagonal elements contain an odd power of any coordinate and therefore\nvanish:\n\\(\\langle X|V|Y\\rangle=\\langle X|V|Z\\rangle=\\cdots =0\\).\n\nHence the three Cartesian \\(p\\)-orbitals stay eigenfunctions of the\nperturbation.  \nTo obtain the numerical factors we need the angular averages\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\\langle n_i^{2}n_j^{2}\\rangle =\n\\frac{\\delta_{ij}}{5}+\\frac{1-\\delta_{ij}}{15}}\\qquad(i,j=x,y,z)\n\\]\n\nwhich follow from the fourth‑rank tensor\n\\(\\langle n_i n_j n_k n_\\ell\\rangle=(\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{k\\ell}\n+\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{j\\ell}+\\delta_{i\\ell}\\delta_{jk})/15\\).\n\nConsequently  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\langle X|V|X\\rangle&=\nA\\Bigl(\\tfrac15\\Bigr)+B\\Bigl(\\tfrac1{15}\\Bigr)-(A+B)\\Bigl(\\tfrac1{15}\\Bigr)\n      =\\frac{2}{15}\\,A , \\\\[2mm]\n\\langle Y|V|Y\\rangle&=\nA\\Bigl(\\tfrac1{15}\\Bigr)+B\\Bigl(\\tfrac15\\Bigr)-(A+B)\\Bigl(\\tfrac1{15}\\Bigr)\n      =\\frac{2}{15}\\,B , \\\\[2mm]\n\\langle Z|V|Z\\rangle&=\nA\\Bigl(\\tfrac1{15}\\Bigr)+B\\Bigl(\\tfrac1{15}\\Bigr)-(A+B)\\Bigl(\\tfrac15\\Bigr)\n      =-\\frac{2}{15}(A+B) .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nEvery matrix element carries the same radial factor\n\\(\\displaystyle \\mathcal R\\equiv\\int_0^\\infty r^{4}|f(r)|^{2}\\,dr\\);\nit multiplies all three results equally and therefore drops out of the\nrelative splittings.\n\n---\n\n#### Relative energy shifts  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\Delta E_X:\\Delta E_Y:\\Delta E_Z = A:B:-(A+B)} .\n\\]\n\nGraphically the original triply degenerate \\(p\\) level separates into three\nlevels whose displacements from the centre are proportional to \\(A,\\;B\\) and\n\\(-(A+B)\\) respectively.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### (b) Expectation value of \\(L_z\\)\n\nThe orbital‐angular‑momentum operator is  \n\n\\[\nL_z=-i\\hbar\\bigl(x\\partial_y-y\\partial_x\\bigr).\n\\]\n\nActing on the real Cartesian functions,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nL_z\\,(x f)&=-i\\hbar\\,y f , &\nL_z\\,(y f)&=+i\\hbar\\,x f ,&\nL_z\\,(z f)&=0 .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSince the three eigenstates are purely \\(|X\\rangle,|Y\\rangle,|Z\\rangle\\),\n\n\\[\n\\langle X|L_z|X\\rangle =\\langle Y|L_z|Y\\rangle\n                     =\\langle Z|L_z|Z\\rangle =0 .\n\\]\n\n(The usual magnetic quantum numbers \\(m=\\pm1,0\\) arise from the complex\ncombinations \\((|X\\rangle\\pm i|Y\\rangle)/\\sqrt2\\); those are **not**\neigenstates of the given anisotropic perturbation.)\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\langle L_z\\rangle_{X}=%\n       \\langle L_z\\rangle_{Y}=%\n       \\langle L_z\\rangle_{Z}=0 } .\n\\]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Final results**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{ccl}\n\\Delta E_X &\\propto& \\displaystyle \\frac{2}{15}\\,A,\\\\[4pt]\n\\Delta E_Y &\\propto& \\displaystyle \\frac{2}{15}\\,B,\\\\[4pt]\n\\Delta E_Z &\\propto& \\displaystyle -\\frac{2}{15}\\,(A+B),\\\\[6pt]\n\\langle L_z\\rangle_X&=&\\langle L_z\\rangle_Y\n                      =\\langle L_z\\rangle_Z =0 .\n\\end{array}}\n\\]"}

The beam initially moving along x passes through gradient ∂B_z/∂z; deflection depends on μ_z component.\n\nCase i: Polarized along +z means all spins are up relative to z axis => they are eigenstate |↑_z>. So after SG, only one spot displaced upward (+Δz), no split.\n\nCase ii: Polarized along +x meaning state is equal superposition of ↑_z and ↓_z: |↑_x> = (|↑_z> + |↓_z>) / √2 . Passing through SG measuring Sz yields probabilistic outcome: half go up, half down, giving two spots equally intense.\n\nCase iii: Polarized along +y: |↑_y> = (|↑_z> + i|↓_z>) /√2 . Same probabilities as case ii: 50% each, so same intensity distribution as case ii – cannot tell difference from just this measurement because both give 2 spots equal intensities.\n\nCase iv: Unpolarized mixture: statistical ensemble where half are up, half down but incoherent mixture. Also leads to two spots with equal intensity. However there may be subtle differences? In standard SG, you can't differentiate coherent superposition vs mixed state using single SG measurement; you'd get identical patterns.\n\nThus indistinguishability between cases (ii),(iii),(iv).\n\nPart b: To distinguish we can add another SG oriented differently downstream or insert phase shifters etc. Example: After first SG that splits into up/down beams, recombine them via appropriate magnetic fields to form interferometer; then measure along other axes. Or perform sequential measurements: e.g., take output beams separately and send each through second SG aligned along x or y. For pure states prepared along +x, passing through SG_z gave random result, but subsequent SG_x will re-polarize fully: If you select the upper branch (spin-up_z) and feed it into SG_x, you'll see 50/50 again? Actually starting from |↑_z>, measurement of S_x yields 50/50. But for original preparation +x, before selection you had coherence; however once separated, decoherence occurs due to spatial separation—so effectively becomes mixture. Distinguishing requires not separating physically maybe using weak measurement? Another method: Use a third magnet producing homogeneous transverse field causing Larmor precession before entering SG_z. Rotating spin about z-axis changes phases between components; for |↑_x> versus |↑_y> differ by relative phase. By applying a known rotation around z (e.g., uniform B_z region) you convert |↑_x> → cosθ|↑_z>+ sinθ|↓_z>? Wait rotation about z adds phase factor exp(-iσ_z φ/2): transforms |↑_x> -> (|↑_z> + e^{-iφ}|↓_z>)/√2 ; similarly |↑_y> gets extra phase shift leading to measurable change when later measured along x. Thus sequence: apply B_z region length such that rotates spin about z by π/2, then pass through SG_z. For initial +x, after rotation become +y, still 50/50. Not helpful. Better: rotate about y axis to map x polarization onto z basis. Apply homogeneous B_y field to cause Rabi rotation turning |↑_x> into |↑_z> while leaving |↑_y> into superposition with different amplitudes. Then SG_z would yield distinct distributions.\n\nSpecifically: Use a uniform magnetic field B_y over distance L causing spin precession angle θ=γ B_y L/v. Choose θ=π/2. This maps |↑_x>→|↑_z>; |↑_y>→|↓_z>. Therefore after SG_z you get single spot either up or down depending on initial orientation, distinguishing them. Meanwhile unpolarized remains split 50/50 regardless of rotation.\n\nAlternatively, do tomography: Perform three successive SG measurements along orthogonal axes on identically prepared ensembles. Measure fractions of up outcomes for each axis; reconstruct Bloch vector. Pure +x has ⟨Sz⟩=0, ⟨Sy⟩=0, ⟨Sx⟩=+½. Mixed/unpolarized has zero expectation for all. So measuring along x directly distinguishes.\n\nBut note that our apparatus measures only Sz. We could orient the whole SG device rotated so its gradient points along desired axis. That is equivalent to rotating the quantization axis. Using mechanical rotation of magnets or adding bias fields to define new measurement axis.\n\nSo answer: Cases (ii)-(iv) give same pattern; to discriminate, use second SG oriented along x or y, or introduce a uniform magnetic field to rotate spin prior to measurement, performing quantum state tomography.\n\nNow craft final response with clear description and LaTeX box.\n\nassistantfinal**Answer**\n\nLet  \n\n\\[\n|\\uparrow _z\\rangle ,\\qquad |\\downarrow _z\\rangle ,\n\\]\n\nbe the eigen‑kets of \\(S_{z}\\;(=\\hbar\\sigma _z/2)\\) with eigenvalues  \n\\(+\\frac{\\hbar}{2},-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\).   \nFor a spin‑\\(1/2\\) neutral particle the magnetic moment operator is\n\\(\\boldsymbol {\\mu}= \\gamma\\,\\mathbf {S}\\); therefore the force in the\ninhomogeneous field \\(B_{z}(z)\\) is proportional to the value of \\(\\mu _z\\)\nand the detector records a vertical displacement \\(\\Delta z\\propto\\mu _z\\).\nConsequently the Stern–Gerlach (SG) apparatus performs a **projective\nmeasurement of \\(S_{z}\\)**.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### (a)   Pattern produced by the four preparations  \n\n| Preparation of the incoming beam | State written in the \\(|\\!\\uparrow _z\\rangle,\n|\\!\\downarrow _z\\rangle\\) basis | Probabilities for the SG‑\\(z\\) measurement |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| (i) Polarised *along* \\(+z\\)      | \\(|\\psi_i\\rangle =|\\uparrow _z\\rangle\\)                | \\(P_{\\uparrow }=1,\\; P_{\\downarrow }=0\\)    |\n| (ii) Polarised *along* \\(+x\\)     | \\(|\\psi_{ii}\\rangle =|\\uparrow _x\\rangle=\n\\displaystyle\\frac{| \\uparrow _z\\rangle+| \\downarrow _z\\rangle}\n{\\sqrt 2}\\)                                            | \\(P_{\\uparrow }=P_{\\downarrow }=1/2\\)       |\n| (iii) Polarised *along* \\(+y\\)    | \\(|\\psi_{iii}\\rangle =|\\uparrow _y\\rangle=\n\\displaystyle\\frac{| \\uparrow _z\\rangle+i| \\downarrow _z\\rangle}\n{\\sqrt 2}\\)                                           | \\(P_{\\uparrow }=P_{\\downarrow }=1/2\\)       |\n| (iv) Unpolarised (maximally mixed)| Density matrix \\(\\rho_{iv}= \\tfrac12\n\\bigl(|\\uparrow _z\\rangle\\langle\\uparrow _z|\n        +|\\downarrow _z\\rangle\\langle\\downarrow _z|\\bigr)\\) | \\(P_{\\uparrow }=P_{\\downarrow }=1/2\\) |\n\nHence the observed **spatial pattern** on the screen is  \n\n* (i) a **single bright spot**, shifted upwards (\\(+\\Delta z\\)).  \n* (ii) two spots of **equal intensity**, one up (\\(+\\Delta z\\)) and one down (\\(-\\Delta z\\)).  \n* (iii) exactly the same two‑spot pattern as in (ii).  \n* (iv) again the same two‑spot pattern as in (ii) and (iii).\n\nTherefore the SG‑\\(z\\) apparatus alone cannot separate the situations\n(ii)–(iv); they are experimentally indistinguishable in a single run.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### (b)   How to distinguish the “indistinguishable’’ cases  \n\nTo resolve whether the incident beam was a coherent superposition\n(\\(+x\\) or \\(+y\\)) or an incoherent mixture (unpolarised) one needs a\nsecond operation that makes the relative phase between \\(|\\uparrow _z\\rangle\\)\nand \\(|\\downarrow _z\\rangle\\) observable.

{"id": "atomic/2-32", "questions": "The numbers of protons and neutrons are roughly equal for stable lighter nuclei; however, the number of neutrons is substantially greater than the number of protons for stable heavy nuclei. For light nuclei, the energy required to remove a proton or a neutron from the nucleus is roughly the same; however, for heavy nuclei, more energy is required to remove a proton than a neutron. Explain these facts, assuming that the specific nuclear forces are exactly equal between all pairs of nucleons.", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to explain why N≈Z for light stable nuclei but N>Z for heavy ones, given identical strong force among any pair (i.e., charge independence). The difference arises due to Coulomb repulsion among protons which grows with Z^2/R ~ Z^2/A^{1/3}. To minimize total energy, heavier nuclei add extra neutrons to increase binding via strong interaction without adding coulomb repulsion, thus increasing stability.\n\nAlso removal energies: separation energy S_p vs S_n differ because of Coulomb term. In liquid drop model, binding energy B = a_v A - a_s A^(2/3) - a_c Z(Z-1)/A^(1/3) - a_a (N-Z)^2 / A + δ(A,Z). Proton removal reduces both volume/surface terms similarly but also removes one unit of Coulomb repulsion, making it easier? Actually removing a proton decreases Coulomb repulsion so less penalty, meaning you might think it's easier to remove a proton. But observed opposite: requires more energy to remove a proton than neutron for heavy nuclei. Wait typical data: Neutron separation energy generally larger than proton separation energy for heavy isotopes near beta-stability line? Let's recall: On valley of stability, as Z increases, N > Z such that asymmetry term balances Coulomb. At optimum N/Z ratio, derivative dB/dZ=0 leads to condition about symmetry term etc. That yields higher binding per added proton compared to neutron? Need compute separation energies:\n\nS_n(N,Z)=B(N,Z)-B(N-1,Z)\nS_p(N,Z)=B(N,Z)-B(N,Z-1)\n\nUsing semi-empirical mass formula ignoring pairing, we can derive approximate expressions showing S_p < S_n for heavy nuclei on stability line? Actually question says \"more energy is required to remove a proton than a neutron\" i.e., S_p > S_n . So they claim proton separation energy bigger. Let's test quickly using SEMF parameters: a_v~15.8 MeV, a_s~18.3, a_c~0.714, a_a~23.2. Consider lead-208: Z=82,N=126,A=208. Compute S_n ≈ B(126,82)-B(125,82); S_p ≈ B(126,82)-B(126,81). Use approximations maybe get S_n~7.9MeV, S_p~8.0?? Not sure. Anyway explanation: Because to keep stability, heavy nuclei have excess neutrons; removing a neutron moves composition closer to optimal N/Z reducing asymmetry cost, thereby lowering net binding loss => lower separation energy. Removing a proton worsens Coulomb deficit relative to needed balance, raising energy cost. Also Coulomb barrier adds potential well depth for protons inside nucleus, requiring additional energy to overcome electrostatic attraction plus nuclear binding.\n\nThus answer: Even if nuclear force equal, overall binding includes Coulomb repulsion and Pauli principle leading to different Fermi levels for protons/neutrons when N≠Z. Heavy nuclei require many neutrons to fill up states while keeping protons fewer to reduce Coulomb pressure. Hence separation energies reflect differences in chemical potentials.\n\nProvide reasoning steps: use liquid-drop model, set ∂B/∂Z|_A =0 gives equilibrium N/Z approx 1+ (a_c/(2 a_a)) * A^{2/3}, giving N> Z for large A. Then discuss separation energies derived from partial derivatives: μ_n = -(∂M/∂N)_Z ; μ_p similar including Coulomb term -> μ_p deeper (more bound) than μ_n for stable heavy nuclei, hence larger removal energy.\n\nWill produce final boxed expression perhaps give relation N−Z ≈ (a_c/2a_a) A^{2/3}. And statement S_p>S_n.\n\nLet's craft answer.assistantfinal**Explanation**\n\nEven if the strong‑force part of the nucleon–nucleon interaction were completely charge independent – i.e. the “specific” nuclear force has the same strength for every \\(nn,\\;pp\\) and \\(np\\) pair – the **total** binding energy of a nucleus contains two other contributions  \n\n* the long‑range **Coulomb repulsion** acting only between protons,\n* the kinetic‐energy contribution coming from the Pauli exclusion principle (the “symmetry’’ term).\n\nThese two effects make the energetically most favourable configuration change with the size of the nucleus.  \nThe simplest quantitative description is provided by the semi‑empirical (liquid‑drop) mass formula\n\n\\[\nB(N,Z)=a_{v}\\!A-a_{s}\\!A^{2/3}\n      -a_{c}\\frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}}\n      -a_{a}\\frac{(N-Z)^{2}}{A}+{\\rm pairing},\n\\qquad   A=N+Z .\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nAll coefficients (\\(a_{v},a_{s},a_{c},a_{a}>0\\)) are constants determined empirically;\n\\(a_{c}=0.71\\,\\text{MeV}\\) measures the Coulomb repulsion, whereas \n\\(a_{a}=23.2\\,\\text{MeV}\\) quantifies how much energy is lost when the numbers of neutrons and protons become unequal (Pauli‑principle effect).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### 1. Why do heavy stable nuclei contain many more neutrons?\n\nFor a fixed mass number \\(A\\) the most tightly bound isotope is obtained by maximising \\(B\\), i.e. by setting  \n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial Z}\\right) _{A}=0 .\n\\]\n\nFrom Eq.(1),\n\n\\[\n-\\;a_{c}\\,\\frac{2Z-1}{A^{1/3}}\n    +a_{a}\\,\\frac{4(N-Z)}{A}=0 ,\n\\]\n\nwhich after neglecting the small ‘‑1’ term gives the familiar result\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\displaystyle \\frac{N-Z}{A}\\;\\approx\\;\n\\frac{a_{c}}{2a_{a}}\\;A^{2/3}\n}\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nor equivalently   \n\n\\[\nN\\simeq Z+\\frac{a_{c}}{2a_{a}}\\,A^{2/3}.\n\\]\n\nBecause the factor \\(A^{2/3}\\) grows rapidly with the size of the nucleus, the right‑hand side becomes appreciable already for moderate masses:\nfor \\(A\\sim 50\\) the correction is \\(\\sim0.05A\\) (about three extra neutrons);\nfor \\(A\\sim200\\) it reaches \\(\\sim0.12A\\) (roughly twenty‑four extra neutrons).\nHence **light nuclei can stay close to \\(N=Z\\)**, whereas **heavy stable nuclei must possess a substantial neutron excess** in order to compensate the growing Coulomb repulsion among their many protons.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### 2. Separation energies: why does it take more energy to knock out a proton than a neutron from a heavy stable nucleus?\n\nDefine the single‑particle separation (removal) energies\n\n\\[\nS_{n}(N,Z)=B(N,Z)-B(N-1,Z),\n\\qquad   \nS_{p}(N,Z)=B(N,Z)-B(N,Z-1).\n\\]\n\nIn the liquid‑drop picture the dominant parts of these quantities are just the negative of the corresponding chemical potentials,\n\n\\[\n\\mu_{n}= -\\Bigl(\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial N}\\Bigr)_{Z},\n\\qquad    \n\\mu_{p}= -\\Bigl(\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial Z}\\Bigr)_{N},\n\\]\nwith \\(M=A m_{\\!u}-B/c^{2}\\).\n\nTaking the derivative of Eq.(1) with respect to \\(N\\) and \\(Z\\) separately (and again discarding the tiny surface‑pairing corrections) yields\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_{n}&\\simeq a_{v}-a_{s}A^{-1/3}\n        -a_{a}\\frac{4(N-Z)+2}{A},\\\\[2mm]\nS_{p}&\\simeq a_{v}-a_{s}A^{-1/3}\n        -a_{c}\\frac{2Z-1}{A^{1/3}}\n        -a_{a}\\frac{-4(N-Z)+2}{A}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\n\\]\n\nOn the valley of β‑stability the relationship (2) holds, i.e.  \n\n\\[\nN-Z=\\frac{a_{c}}{2a_{a}}A^{2/3}.\n\\]\n\nInsert this into Eqs.(3):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_{n}&\\simeq a_{v}-a_{s}A^{-1/3}\n          -2a_{c}A^{1/3}+O(A^{-1}), \\\\[2mm]\nS_{p}&\\simeq a_{v}-a_{s}A^{-1/3}\n          +2a_{c}A^{1/3}+O(A^{-1}) .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{4}\n\\]\n\nThe **Coulomb term appears with opposite sign**.  \nFor a heavy nucleus (\\(A\\gtrsim100\\)), the magnitude of the last term,\n\\(2a_{c}A^{1/3}\\), far exceeds the modest residual pieces proportional to\n\\(A^{-1/3}\\). Consequently\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{S_{p}>S_{n}\\quad\\text{(stable heavy nuclei)}} .\n\\]\n\nPhysically this means:\n\n*Removing a neutron* brings the system **closer** to the optimal \\(N/Z\\) dictated by Eq.(2); the reduction of the symmetry‑penalty partially compensates the loss of nuclear binding, so relatively little energy is needed.\n\n*Removing a proton*, instead, **increases** the Coulomb stress (because there remain almost as many protons left behind) and simultaneously drives the nucleus away from its preferred \\(N/Z\\) value. Both effects raise the amount of energy that must be supplied—hence the larger proton separation energy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### Summary\n\n* The equality of the underlying strong force makes the **volume** and **surface** components of the binding energy depend only on the total nucleon number \\(A\\).  \n* The **Coulomb repulsion**, which scales like \\(Z^{2}/A^{1/3}\\), grows faster than the attractive strong component as the nucleus gets heavier. To offset this rising repulsive energy, nature favours configurations with **extra neutrons**, producing the empirical trend \\(N>Z\\) for heavy stable nuclides [Eq.(2)].\n* On the valley of stability the competition between the Coulomb term and the symmetry term fixes a particular \\(N/Z\\) ratio. When a **neutron** is removed the symmetry term is reduced, partly cancelling the loss of binding, whereas removing a **proton** eliminates some Coulomb repulsion but also pushes the nucleus farther from the optimal \\(N/Z\\). The net result is a **larger proton separation energy** than neutron separation energy for heavy nuclei [Eqs.(3)–(4)].\n\nThus, even with perfectly charge‑independent nuclear forces, the presence of electric repulsion together with the Pauli‑exclusion driven symmetry energy explains both observations. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \n\\frac{N-Z}{A}\\;\\approx\\;\\frac{a_{c}}{2a_{a}}\\,A^{2/3},\n\\qquad \nS_{p}>S_{n}\\ {\\rm for\\ stable\\ heavy\\ nuclei}\n}\n\\]"}

Therefore P = -(- (2/3)K V^{-5/3}) = (2/3) K V^{-5/3}.\n\nPlug back K: K = ħ² π² / (2 m)*(4π/3)^{2/3}.\n\nThus P = (2/3) * ħ² π² / (2 m) *(4π/3)^{2/3} * V^{-5/3}\nSimplify factor (2/3)*(1/2) = 1/3.\n\nSo P = (ħ² π²)/(3 m) * (4π/3)^{2/3} * V^{-5/3}.\n\nReplace V = 4π R³/3. Compute V^{-5/3}: ( (4π/3) R³ )^{-5/3}= (4π/3)^{-5/3} * R^{-5} .\n\nBecause exponent: (R³)^(-5/3) = R^{-5}. Good.\n\nTherefore P = (ħ² π²)/(3 m) * (4π/3)^{2/3} * (4π/3)^{-5/3} * R^{-5} = (ħ² π²)/(3 m) * (4π/3)^{(2-5)/3} * R^{-5} = (ħ² π²)/(3 m) * (4π/3)^{-1} * R^{-5} because (2-5)=-3 -> exponent -1.\n\nHence (4π/3)^{-1} = 3/(4π). Thus P = (ħ² π²)/(3 m) * 3/(4π) * R^{-5} = (ħ² π² * 3)/(12 π m) * R^{-5}? Wait multiply numerator: (ħ² π²)(3) over (3*?) let's do carefully:\n\n(ħ² π²)/(3 m) * (3/(4π)) = ħ² π² *3 / (3 m *4π) = ħ² π² / (m *4π) after cancel 3's. Simplify π² / π = π.

Units: ħ ~ kg·m²/s, so ħ²/m ~ (kg²·m⁴/s²)/kg = kg·m⁴/s² = (J·s)?? Actually Joule = kg·m²/s², thus ħ²/m yields kg·m⁴/s² which equals (kg·m²/s²)·m² = J·m².

After β− decay, nuclear charge changes from Z=1 (hydrogen-like with one electron) to Z=2 (helium ion He+), but the electronic wavefunction does not have time to adjust instantly; it's still the hydrogenic ground-state wavefunction of H (Z=1). Then we project onto eigenstates of new Hamiltonian (Helium ion potential V = -Ze²/r with Z=2). So probabilities given by overlap squared between initial wavefunction ψ_i(r)=ψ_{100}^{(Z=1)}(r) and final states φ_nlm^{(Z=2)}(r).\n\nThus compute overlaps:\n\nP_{n,l,m}=|⟨φ_{nlm}^{(Z=2)} | ψ_{100}^{(Z=1)} ⟩|^2.\n\nSince spherically symmetric initial state l=m=0, only final states with same angular part (l=0) will have non-zero overlap because integration over angles yields zero otherwise due to orthogonality of spherical harmonics Y_l^m.

Wait full wavefunction: ψ_{100}(r) = (1/π a_0^3)^{1/2} e^{-r/a_0}. Let's verify: For hydrogen ground state, ψ = (1/π a_0^3)^{1/2} exp(-r/a_0). Indeed that's correct. Equivalent expression using radial part: R_{10}(r) = 2 (Z/a_0)^{3/2} e^{-Z r / a_0}, then total ψ = R/(r)*Y00? Actually standard separation gives ψ = R_{nl}(r) Y_{lm}(θ,ϕ)/r . But many textbooks define radial function u_{nl}(r)=rR_{nl}(r).

Actually wavefunction scales with Z via factor Z^(3/2) etc. General expression: ψ_{n l m}^{(Z)}(r) = Z^{3/2} ψ_{n l m}^{(Z=1)}(Z r). More concretely, radial coordinate scaled: ρ = Z r / a_0. So for 2s:\n\nψ_{200}^{(Z)}(r) = (Z^3 /32π a_0^3)^{1/2} (2 - Z r / a_0) e^{-Z r / (2 a_0)}.\n\nLet’s derive quickly: Normalization constant N = (Z^3 / (32π a_0^3))^{1/2}. Good.\n\nThus for Z=2, ψ_f_2s(r) = (8 / (32π a_0^3))^{1/2} (2 - 2 r / a_0) e^{- r / a_0 }? Because Z=2 leads exponent -Z r/(2 a0) = - r / a0. Prefactor sqrt(8/32π a0^3) = sqrt(1/4π a0^3) = 1/(2√π a0^{3/2}). Check also overall amplitude maybe.\n\nBut better keep symbolic.\n\nOur initial ψ_i = (1/π a0^3)^{1/2} e^{-r/a0}.\n\nNeed overlap integral I = ∫ ψ_{2s}^{(Z=2)}* ψ_i d³r.\n\nBoth real positive.\n\nWrite ψ_2s = N (2 - 2 r / a0) e^{- r / a0 }, where N = (Z^3/(32π a0^3))^{1/2} with Z=2 => N = (8/(32π a0^3))^{1/2} = (1/(4π a0^3))^{1/2}? Wait 8/32 = 1/4. Square root gives 1/2. So N = (1/(2√π a0^{3/2}))? Let's compute: (1/(4π a0^3))^{1/2} = 1/(2√π a0^{3/2}) indeed.\n\nThus ψ_2s = (1/(2√π a0^{3/2})) (2 - 2 r / a0) e^{- r / a0 } = (1/(√π a0^{3/2})) (1 - r / a0) e^{- r / a0 }.\n\nNice simplification.\n\nNow ψ_i = (1/π a0^3)^{1/2} e^{- r / a0 } = (1/√π a0^{3/2}) e^{- r / a0 }.\n\nTherefore product ψ_2s ψ_i = (1/π a0^3) (1 - r / a0) e^{-2 r / a0 }. Multiply by volume element 4π r^2 dr.\n\nOverlap S_2s = ∫ 4π r^2 (1/π a0^3)(1 - r/a0) e^{-2r/a0} dr = (4/ a0^3) ∫ r^2 (1 - r/a0) e^{-2r/a0} dr.\n\nDefine x = 2r/a0 => r = (a0/2)x , dr = (a0/2) dx.\n\nCompute integrand: r^2 = (a0^2/4) x^2. Also (1 - r/a0) = 1 - (x/2).

Actually there was division by 4 inside first term and multiplication by 1/2 later. Let's do stepwise:\n\nCoefficient C = (4/ a0^3) × (a0^2/4) × (a0/2) = (4 * a0^2 * a0) / (a0^3 *4*2) = (4 a0^3) / (8 a0^3) = 1/2.\n\nYes coefficient = 1/2.\n\nThus S_2s = (1/2) ∫_0^\\infty x^2 (1 - x/2) e^{-x} dx.\n\nExpand: x^2 - (x^3)/2.\n\nIntegrals: ∫ x^2 e^{-x} dx = 2! = 2. ∫ x^3 e^{-x} dx = 3! = 6.\n\nHence S_2s = (1/2)[ 2 - (1/2)*6 ] = (1/2)[ 2 - 3 ] = (1/2)(-1) = -1/2.\n\nAbsolute value magnitude 0.5.

So photon ~2.23 MeV.\n\nNow consider recoil: momentum conservation: photon carries momentum E_γ/c ; deuteron recoils opposite direction with kinetic energy T_d = (E_γ)^2/(2 M_d c^2) approx because nonrelativistic? Actually using relativistic but small. Using formula: K_recoil = (E_gamma)^2 / (2 M_d c^2). Convert M_d c^2 = md*931 MeV = about 2.01410*931≈1877 MeV. Then K = (2.23 MeV)^2 /(2*1877 MeV)= (4.97)/(3754)=0.00133 MeV = 1.3 keV. That's negligible compared to 2.23 MeV, so recoil not important.\n\nPart b: Need estimate required kinetic energy such that l=1 partial wave penetrates barrier i.e., angular momentum barrier L = ħ sqrt(l(l+1))/r . For low-energy scattering, centrifugal potential V_l(r) = ℏ² l(l+1)/ (2 μ r² ). To get significant overlap within nuclear radius (~deuteron size), kinetic energy should exceed this barrier height at distance comparable to range R~4e-13 cm. Reduced mass μ ≈ mp mn/(mp+mn) ≈ (1.0078*1.0087)/(2.0165) amu ≈ roughly 0.504 amu? Wait compute numerically: product = 1.016... let's approximate: 1.00783*1.00867 = 1.01658. Divide by 2.0165 gives 0.5039 amu. In MeV units μc^2 = 0.5039*931 ≈ 469 MeV.\n\nCentrifugal barrier: V_c = ℏ² l(l+1) / (2μR²).\n\nℏ in CGS erg s: 1.05e-25 erg·s. Convert to MeV·fm maybe easier. But we can use CGS then convert.\n\nFirst find ℏc =197 MeV fm typical. We'll use that. ℏc =197 MeV·fm. Then ℏ² = (ħc)² / c². However expression uses ℏ²/2μR² where μ expressed as mass (energy/c²). Write V_c = (ħc)² l(l+1) / [2 μc² R²] .\n\nTake µc² = 469 MeV. R = 4×10⁻¹³ cm = 4 fm? Since 1 fm = 1e-13 cm. Yes 4e-13 cm = 4 fm. Good.\n\nCompute numerator: (197 MeV·fm)² = 38809 (MeV·fm)². Multiply by l(l+1)=2 for l=1 → 77618 MeV²·fm².\n\nDenominator: 2 * μc² * R² = 2 * 469 MeV * (4 fm)² = 938 MeV *16 fm² =15008 MeV·fm².\n\nThus V_c = 77618 /15008 MeV = 5.17 MeV.\n\nSo need relative kinetic energy > few MeV to overcome centrifugal barrier.

In addition, the α‑cluster’s pre‑formation probability is far greater than that of any other light cluster.  \n\nConsequently, **α‑decay is overwhelmingly preferred** over direct proton/deuteron/triton emission and over spontaneous fission for the majority of the heaviest naturally occurring radionuclides. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Large }Q_{\\alpha}\\ (>0) \\quad+\\quad \\text{moderate Coulomb barrier}\\\\\n&\\Longrightarrow\\ \\text{highest decay probability among light‐cluster modes.}\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\]"}

Explain, with such relevant quantitative arguments as you can muster, this striking difference.", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to explain why alpha decay dominates over proton radioactivity (proton emission) especially for heavy nuclei; proton emission occurs only near drip line where Q-value positive etc., rare.\n\nNeed to discuss Coulomb barrier heights, tunneling probabilities, binding energies per nucleon, separation energy differences, nuclear potential depth, quantum mechanical penetrabilities using Gamow factor. For α-decay typical Q~ several MeV up to ~10 MeV, while for proton emission Q-values smaller due to higher Coulomb barrier? Actually both have Coulomb barriers, but α particle has charge +2e vs proton +1e, so barrier height larger for α, yet α still emitted because it carries away more mass/energy reducing Coulomb repulsion inside nucleus? Need to consider preformation probability: α cluster formation high due to strong pairing correlations, whereas single-proton less likely to form a bound state outside core? Also shell effects.\n\nQuantitative: Use semi-empirical mass formula to compute separation energies Sα = B(A,Z)-B(A-4,Z-2). Show that for heavy nuclei Sα often negative (i.e., Q>0), leading to possible α decay. Proton separation energy Sp = B(A,Z)-B(A-1,Z-1); typically positive even for heavy stable isotopes; becomes negative only close to proton dripline. So most heavy nuclei have positive Sp thus cannot emit protons spontaneously.\n\nEven when Qp >0, penetration probability P ∝ exp[-2π Z_d e^2 / ħv] (Gamow factor). Compare exponent for α vs p given same kinetic energy: barrier width bigger for α due to double charge => exponential suppression stronger. However α particles also have larger reduced mass -> lower velocity for same Q, making exponent larger again. Yet observed rates show α decays happen faster than many β decays.\n\nBut key point: The main reason is energetics: α-particle binding energy (~28 MeV) makes removal of four nucleons favorable if total binding loss < sum of separate nucleons; leads to sizable Q values (>5 MeV). In contrast removing one proton costs its separation energy which is usually >8 MeV for heavy nuclei, rarely exceeds zero.\n\nProvide numbers: Using SEMF parameters, calculate Sp ≈ -a_c * (Z-1)/A^{1/3}+... maybe approximate. Let's do quick estimate: For A≈200, Z≈82. Compute Sp from liquid drop ignoring pairing term: B/A approx 7.9 MeV. But we want separation energy: Sp ≈ -∂B/∂Z? Better use empirical data: For Pb-208, proton separation energy about 7.4 MeV, neutron separation around 7.6 MeV. Thus Qp would be negative unless excited states above threshold. Alpha separation energy for same nucleus: Qα ≈ 5.0 MeV (actually ^212Po emits α with Q=8.95 MeV). So α easier.\n\nAlso mention that α clusters already exist within nucleus due to strong correlation; preformation factor ~10^{-2}–10^{-1}, while proton preformation essentially unity but overall rate suppressed by low Q.\n\nProton radioactivity observed mainly for odd-Z nuclei beyond Z≈50 near drip line, half-lives microseconds to seconds, requiring Q_p few hundred keV to couple with barrier.\n\nThus answer should combine energetic argument via mass formulas showing α emission yields larger Q-values for heavy nuclei, plus tunnelling considerations showing comparable or slightly worse barrier but compensated by larger Q. Therefore α decay much more probable.\n\nWill produce final boxed expression summarizing ratio perhaps: Γ_α/Γ_p ~ exp[(G_p-G_α)] × (P_preform)_ratio . Could give numeric example: For ^210Po (Qα=5.41MeV) gives T½≈138 d ; hypothetical proton emission with similar Q would have half-life orders magnitude longer due to barrier.\n\nLet's craft response.assistantfinalThe essential difference between \\(\\alpha\\)‑decay and proton‐emission lies not in the shape of the Coulomb barrier – which is actually **higher** for an \\(\\alpha\\) particle because it carries twice the charge – but in the **energetics** of separating the two kinds of fragments from a heavy nucleus and in the corresponding tunnelling probabilities.  \n\nBelow we compare quantitatively the quantities that control the partial widths  \n\\[\n\\Gamma_{x}=S_{x}\\,P_{x},\n\\qquad x=\\alpha ,\\,p ,\n\\]\nwhere \\(S_{x}\\) is the “pre‑formation” (or spectroscopic) factor and   \n\\(P_{x}\\) is the WKB transmission coefficient through the Coulomb+centrifugal barrier.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### 1.

Need discuss that neutrino interacts via charged current producing muon plus hadrons. For νμ + N → μ⁻ + X . Single K− can arise from associated strange particle production without charm e.g., νμ + n → μ⁻ + Λ + K+. But that's K+, not K-. Production of K- requires creation of s̄ quark which cannot come from target nucleon's valence content easily; you would need pair ssbar produced then combine s-bar with u to make K-, while s goes elsewhere possibly forming hyperon. However K- can also appear from secondary interactions (re-scattering) or from anticharm meson decays like D¯0→K+ π‑? Not relevant. In neutrino CC scattering, primary process produces a µ- and a W boson turning d->u etc. To get K- you'd need a cc̅ pair? Let's think: D0 contains c anti-u. Its decay yields K- (s anti-u) + pi+ (u anti-d). So if D0 is produced, its decay gives K- among other particles. Observing only a single K- may indicate D0 production followed by its decay where the accompanying π+ was missed/not detected. However there are alternative mechanisms: direct associated production νµ + N -> µ- + K- + something else (e.g., Σ+?). Check charge conservation: initial lepton number Lν=1, after interaction produce µ- (L=-1?) Actually lepton number conserved separately. Charged current: νµ converts to µ- emitting W+. At partonic level, νµ + d → µ- + u (via W+ exchange). That creates extra up-quark. Strange quarks can be produced via gluon splitting g→ss̄ leading to K- formation together with another strange baryon such as Λ. Example reaction: νµ + n → µ- + K- + p (?) Charge check: neutron (udd) becomes proton (uud)+ ... hmm. Might be possible through Cabibbo suppressed processes?\n\nBut typical signature of charm production in neutrino experiments is opposite-sign dimuon events: νµ + N → µ- + cX, c → s µ+ νµ giving second positive muon. A single K- alone does NOT uniquely signal D0 because kaons can be produced non-charmly. Therefore statement likely FALSE.

Unpolarized electron ensemble means statistical mixture not pure state. Cannot be represented as single wavefunction because it's mixed state; you use density matrix.

Option (c) says neither. The best answer is (b). But some might argue (a) false because equal superposition would still be polarized along x direction maybe? Actually equal amplitude up/down with random phase yields no net polarization? A coherent superposition gives definite spin orientation (e.g., along x), which is polarized.

Find the maximum longitudinal momentum that a pion can have in the laboratory.", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to parse problem.\n\nGiven K_L (neutral kaon) mass M=498 MeV/c²; it decays into two pions each with m=140 MeV/c² (charged). In lab frame, Kaon has momentum such that p/(M c)=1 => p = M c . So its total energy E_K = sqrt((pc)^2 + (M c^2)^2 )? Actually pc = p*c? Wait units: Usually we set c=1 but they keep explicit. Given p / (M c) =1 -> p = M c. Then kinetic energy etc.\n\nGoal: find max possible transverse component of momentum that any decay pion can have in lab, i.e., perpendicular to original direction of motion of parent particle. Also max longitudinal momentum (parallel).\n\nIn rest frame of K, both pions emitted back-to-back with equal magnitude due to conservation of momentum. Compute their momentum magnitude q* (star denotes CM frame). Use two-body decay formula:\n\nq* = ((M^2 - 4m^2)/(4))^{1/2} * (c?) Let's compute using natural units where c=1 then convert later.\n\nEnergy of each pion in CM: E*_π = (M^2 + m^2)/ (2M)? Wait general: For decay A → B+C, energies in rest frame of A:\nE_B = (M_A^2 + m_B^2 - m_C^2)/(2 M_A)\nIf masses same (both pions), then E_* = (M^2 + m^2 - m^2)/(2M) = (M^2 + m^2 - m^2)/(2M) = M/2 ? No that's not right because if identical masses, you get E_B = (M_A^2 + m_B^2 - m_C^2)/(2 M_A) = (M^2 + m^2 - m^2)/(2M) = M/2. Indeed each gets half the parent's rest energy ignoring binding. But check physically: If M > 2m, there will be kinetic energy left. Energy per pion should be (M^2+ m^2 - m^2)/(2M) = M/2 indeed independent of m! That seems odd. Let's verify via invariant s: In rest frame, total energy = M. Momentum magnitude squared: p*^2 = [M^2 - 4 m^2]/(4). Because from relation: E_*^2 = p*^2 + m^2 ; also sum of energies = M so 2E_* = M ⇒ E_* = M/2. Therefore p*^2 = E_*^2 - m^2 = (M^2/4)- m^2 = (M^2 - 4 m^2)/4. Yes correct. Good.\n\nCompute numbers: M = 498 MeV, m = 140 MeV.\n\nM^2 = 498^2 ≈ 248004. m^2 = 19600. 4 m^2 = 78400. Subtract: M^2 - 4 m^2 = 248004 - 78400 = 169604. Divide by 4 gives p*^2 = 42401 MeV^2. Square root: p* ≈ √42401 ≈ 206 MeV/c. Check: sqrt 42401 ~ 205.9. So momentum magnitude in CM about 206 MeV/c.\n\nNow transform to lab where parent moves along z-direction with speed β corresponding to p = Mc. Determine γ factor: p = γ M v = γ M β c. Since p = M c, divide by M c: γβ = 1. And gamma = 1/sqrt(1-β^2). Solve γβ =1.\n\nLet’s solve: βγ =1 => β /sqrt(1-β^2) =1 => square: β^2 /(1-β^2) =1 => β^2 = 1-β^2 => 2β^2 =1 => β^2 = ½ => β = 1/√2 ≈0.7071. Then γ = 1/√(1-β^2) = 1/√(1-0.5)=1/√0.5 = √2≈1.4142. Verify product γβ = √2 * 1/√2 =1 good.\n\nThus Lorentz boost along z axis with γ=√2, β=1/√2.\n\nMomentum components transformation: For a particle with four-momentum (E*, p*_z, p*_⊥ ), after boost along z:\n\np_z_lab = γ(p*_z + β E*/c)\n\nE_lab = γ(E* + β p*_z c)\n\nTransverse components unchanged: p_perp_lab = p*_perp (since boost parallel only changes longitudinal and time components). However note that magnitude may change due to different orientation relative to boost.\n\nOur goal: maximize transverse component observed among all possible emission angles θ* measured in CM between pion momentum vector and boost direction (+z). Transverse component in lab equals p*_⊥ = p* sinθ*. That's independent of boost. So maximal transverse occurs when sinθ*=1 i.e., θ*=90°, giving p_trans_max = p* = 206 MeV/c. Is this allowed given kinematics? yes, one pion could be emitted sideways in CM while other opposite side ensures net zero momentum. After boost, the transverse remains same magnitude. Thus maximum transverse momentum of either pion in lab is just p* = 206 MeV/c.\n\nBut wait maybe due to boost, the transverse component might increase because of aberration? Actually Lorentz transformation leaves perpendicular components unchanged (in terms of spatial components orthogonal to boost): p'_⊥ = p_⊥ . So it's constant. So answer: p_Tmax = 206 MeV/c.\n\nNow maximum longitudinal momentum (along beam direction) of a pion in lab. We want to choose angle θ* that maximizes p_z_lab expression.\n\np_z = γ(p* cosθ* + β E*) .\n\nSince p* fixed, E* = M/2 = 249 MeV (half of 498). Convert to energy units: E* = 249 MeV.\n\nPlug values: γ = √2 ≈1.4142, β = 1/√2 ≈0.7071.\n\nDefine function f(cosθ) = p_z = γ(p* cosθ + β E*)\n\nMaximum over cosθ ∈ [-1,1] occurs at largest value of term inside parentheses since γ positive. Inside: g = p* cosθ + β E*. Cosθ ranges -1..1. So max when cosθ = 1 (i.e., forward emission). Then g_max = p* + β E*.\n\nCalculate numeric: p* = 206 MeV/c. β E* = 0.7071 * 249 MeV ≈ 176.0 MeV. Sum = 382 MeV/c.\n\nMultiply by γ = 1.4142 => p_z,max ≈ 540 MeV/c.\n\nLet's compute more precisely: p* = sqrt[(M^2 - 4 m^2)]/2 = ?\n\nBetter compute exact numbers: Using earlier p*^2 = (M^2 - 4 m^2)/4. With M=498, m=140.\n\nM^2 = 498^2 = 248,004. 4 m^2 = 4*(19,600) =78,400. Difference =169,604. Divided by 4 =42,401. So p* = sqrt(42,401) = 206.0 exactly? sqrt 42401 = 206.0 (since 206^2 = 42436, close). Let's calculate accurately: 206^2 = 42436, difference -35. So actual sqrt slightly less than 206, around 205.95. We'll use 206 MeV/c approx.\n\nBeta*E*: beta = 1/√2 =0.7071068. Multiply by 249 MeV yields 176.3 MeV.\n\nAdd p*: 206 + 176.3 = 382.3 MeV.\n\nTimes gamma √2 =1.4142136 => 382.3*1.4142 = 540.5 MeV/c.\n\nSo maximum longitudinal momentum ~ 540 MeV/c.\n\nCheck whether any constraints like cannot exceed total momentum of parent plus internal? Parent's momentum is Pc = M c = 498 MeV/c. Pion can't have larger than something? It appears bigger than parent momentum due to addition of internal momentum component aligned with boost. This is plausible.\n\nAlternatively perhaps they'd ask \"maximum longitudinal momentum\" meaning absolute value along direction of parent movement (positive). Could also consider negative case minimal (most backward) which would give min p_z possibly even negative. Not needed.\n\nThus answers:\n\np_T(max) = p* = √[(M^2 - 4 m^2)]/2c ≈ 2.06×10^2 MeV/c.\n\np_L(max) = γ (p* + β M/2) = ... ≈ 5.40 ×10^2 MeV/c.\n\nProvide results in box.\n\nAlso include steps explanation.\n\nWill present formulas.\n\nMake sure to express as momentum (MeV/c).

Momentum p_lab = 100 GeV/c → gamma factor γ = E/m where total energy E = sqrt(p²c²+m²c⁴)/c²? In natural units c=1 so E = √(p² + m²). Compute:\n\np = 100 GeV; m = 3.097 GeV. So E≈√(10000 +9.588)=~100.0479 GeV approx. Gamma ~E/m ≈100.05/3.097 ≈32.28.\n\nMean proper lifetime τ0 = ħ/Γ_width. Need value of ħ in appropriate units: ħc =197.326 MeV·fm. But easier: Convert Γ = 63 keV =6.3×10^{-2} MeV. Then τ0 = ħ/Γ = (6.582119569e-22 MeV·s)/(6.3e-2 MeV) = about 1.045e-20 s. Let's calculate precisely: 6.582e-22 / 0.063 = 1.0457e-20 s.\n\nNow dilated lifetime τ_lab = γ τ0 ≈ 32.28 * 1.046e-20 s = 3.38e-19 s.\n\nDistance travelled L = β c τ_lab. Since v≈c because high momentum. β = p/E ≈ 100/100.048 ≈0.99952. Approx close to 1. So L ≈ c τ_lab ≈ (3.0e8 m/s)*(3.38e-19 s) = 1.014e-10 m = 0.101 nm = 1 Å? Wait that's 1e-10 m indeed. Could also multiply by beta slightly less than 1 gives similar result.\n\nThus part (a): mean distance ≈ 1.0 ×10^{-10} meters (~0.1 nanometer).\n\nPart (b): Symmetric decay meaning both leptons have equal magnitude momentum in lab frame. This occurs when decay products are emitted perpendicular to motion? Not exactly. We need to solve kinematics: In J/ψ rest frame, each lepton gets energy E* = m_J/2 = 1.5485 GeV (since masses negligible compared to that). Their three-momentum magnitude p* = sqrt(E*^2 - m_e^2) ≈ E* since me small (511 keV). So p* ≈ 1.55 GeV.\n\nIn lab frame moving with boost γ along z-direction (the original J/ψ momentum). The four-momenta transform: For a given emission angle θ* relative to boost axis, the lab energy is E = γ (E* + β p* cosθ*) ; longitudinal component p_z = γ (p* cosθ* + β E*); transverse components unchanged: p_T = p* sinθ*. Symmetry condition \"same laboratory momenta\" means magnitudes |p_+| = |p_-| . Because they are opposite directions in CM perhaps? In rest frame they go back-to-back. If one goes at angle θ*, other at π−θ*. Transform yields different energies unless special θ* such that resulting lab momenta magnitudes equal. Likely this corresponds to case where electrons have equal lab momenta i.e., their energies equal as well due to negligible mass. That would happen if the boost makes them share equally between forward/backward directions leading to same speed? Let's set up.\n\nLet particle 1 emitted at angle θ* w.r.t boost (+z). Particle 2 emitted opposite direction: angle π − θ*. Its cosine = -cosθ*. Using transformation formulas:\n\nFor particle 1:\nE₁ = γ (E* + β p* cosθ*)\np_{z1}=γ (p* cosθ* + β E*)\n\nParticle 2:\nE₂ = γ (E* + β p* (-cosθ*)) = γ (E* - β p* cosθ*)\np_{z2}=γ (-p* cosθ* + β E*)\n\nTransverse components: Both have same magnitude p_T = p* sinθ* (but opposite azimuthal orientation irrelevant). Magnitude squared of momentum vector:\n\n|p_i|^2 = p_T^2 + p_{zi}^2.\n\nCompute |p₁|² = p_*^2 sin²θ* + γ² (p* cosθ* + β E*)².\n\nSimilarly |p₂|² = p_*^2 sin²θ* + γ² (-p* cosθ* + β E*)².\n\nSet equality -> difference zero:\n\nγ²[(p* cosθ* + β E*)² - (-p* cosθ* + β E*)²] =0.\n\nSimplify inside bracket: Let A = p* cosθ*, B = β E*. Then expression = (A+B)^2 -( -A +B )^2 = (A^2+2AB+B^2)-(A^2-2AB+B^2)=4AB.\n\nSo requirement reduces to γ² * 4 A B =0 ⇒ either A=0 or B=0. B cannot be zero because β non-zero. Therefore A=0 => p* cosθ*=0 => cosθ*=0 => θ* = 90°. Thus symmetric lab momenta occur when decay is orthogonal to boost direction in rest frame (transverse emission). Good.\n\nTherefore electron's lab energy then: plug cosθ*=0 into formula:\n\nE = γ (E* + β p* *0) = γ E* .\n\nSince p* >> me, treat massless approximations. So lab energy per lepton = γ * (m_J/2) = γ * 1.5485 GeV.\n\nWith γ ≈ 32.28, get E ≈ 49.96 GeV ≈ 50 GeV.\n\nCheck consistency: Total lab energy should sum to initial J/ψ energy ≈ 100.05 GeV. Two electrons each ~50 GeV matches.\n\nHence part (b) answer: approximately 50 GeV.\n\nPart (c): Laboratory angle of electron relative to J/ψ direction (boost axis). With θ* = 90°, we can compute tanθ_lab = p_T / p_z.\n\nFrom earlier: p_T = p* sinθ* = p* (since sin90°=1) = p* ≈ 1.55 GeV.\n\np_z = γ (p* cosθ* + β E*) = γ (0 + β E*) = γ β E*.\n\nBut note β≈1 (very close). Compute numerically: β = p/E = 100/100.048 = 0.99952. γβ = γ * β = 32.28 *0.99952 ≈ 32.26.\n\nThen p_z = γ β E* = (γβ)*E* = 32.26 * 1.5485 GeV = 49.95 GeV.\n\nThus tanθ_lab = p_T/p_z = 1.55 / 49.95 ≈ 0.0310.

Will it be readable with an electron microscope? Explain.\"\n\nInterpretation: The idea is printing extremely small text onto a surface; can we read using EM? Need discuss resolution limits of electron microscopy vs physical size of letters, scattering etc.\n\nElectron microscopes have high spatial resolution down to sub-nanometer (~0.1 nm). However reading requires contrast between ink/printing material and substrate. If it's just topography or composition differences detectable via SEM/TEM. Also practical issues: sample preparation, charging, damage from beam, depth-of-field, field of view limited. To read entire page you'd need scanning over huge area with nanometer steps - time-consuming but possible theoretically. But readability also depends on whether information encoded physically as chemical changes resolvable.\n\nIf you could print atomic-scale features representing characters, then yes EM could resolve them if they produce sufficient contrast. However typical inks may not survive vacuum/e-beam; they'd outgas, degrade. Could use metal deposition patterns like e-beam lithography; those would be visible.\n\nThus answer: In principle, electron microscope's resolution far exceeds needed for any realistic font size even if shrunk to few atoms across. So yes, one could image and decode given appropriate imaging mode (TEM/STEM), provided the pattern has enough mass/thickness difference and doesn't charge too much. Practical constraints: field of view, data volume, alignment, noise.\n\nLet's craft explanation: compute minimal feature size required for legibility: human eye ~100 µm per letter; scaling factor maybe 10^6 reduction yields 0.1 µm = 100nm still above EM limit. Even extreme shrink to single atom width unrealistic due to quantum mechanical spread; but EM resolves <0.2 Å.\n\nTherefore answer: Yes, electron microscope can see such tiny writing, assuming proper contrast and no destruction. Provide reasoning about resolution, diffraction limit, de Broglie wavelength λ= h/p; electrons accelerated to 200 keV have λ≈2.5 pm giving theoretical resolution ~0.05 nm after aberrations correction. Real instruments achieve ~50pm.\n\nAlso mention limitations: scanning speed, data processing, radiation damage, requirement of conductive coating.\n\nConclude: Readability feasible in principle though impractical for everyday reading.\n\nProvide final boxed answer summarizing.\n\nassistantfinalThe short answer is **yes – in principle an electron‑microscope can resolve and therefore “read’’ lettering that has been reduced to the dimensions of a postage‑stamp**, provided the printed marks give a measurable contrast to the underlying card.  \n\nBelow is a step–by–step justification.\n\n---\n\n### 1.   Spatial resolution of modern electron microscopes  \n\n* For a TEM operated at \\(E\\!=\\!200~{\\rm keV}\\)\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{e}}=\\frac{h}{p}=2.5\\times10^{-12}\\ {\\rm m}\n\\]\n\nso the diffraction‐limited spot size can be well below \\(0.1\\,\\mathrm{nm}\\).\n\n* State‑of‑the‑art spherical‑aberration corrected STEMs routinely reach  \n\\(r\\simeq 0.04{-}0.07\\;\\text{nm}\\) (40–70 pm) lateral resolution.\n\nHence any structure larger than a few tenths of a nanometre can be imaged directly.\n\n---\n\n### 2.   How small does the “postcard” text have to be?\n\nEven if the whole content of a several‑kilobyte physics book were compressed into a square centimetre, each character would occupy roughly\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{char}}\\sim\\frac{(1\\;\\text{cm})^{2}}{N_{\\text{chars}}}\n          \\approx\\frac{10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}^{2}}{10^{7}}\n          \\approx 10^{-11}\\,\\text{m}^{2},\n\\]\ncorresponding to linear dimensions of order  \n\n\\[\nd\\sim\\sqrt{A_{\\text{char}}}\\approx3\\times10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}=3\\;\\mu\\text{m}.\n\\]\n\nThat is already three orders of magnitude *larger* than the ∼0.1 nm resolution of an EM.  \nIf one tried to push the compression further—say to a true “atomic‑scale” glyph only a few atoms wide—the dimension would become ≲1 nm, which is still comfortably within the capability of current TEM/STEM instrumentation.\n\nSo **any conceivable printable font that fits on a smooth postcard will be many times bigger than the smallest resolvable feature** of an electron microscope.\n\n---\n\n### 3.   Contrast requirements  \n\nAn EM does not detect “ink colour”; it detects variations in:\n\n| Property | Typical source of contrast |\n|----------|----------------------------|\n| Mass / thickness | Heavy‑metal particles, carbon deposits |\n| Atomic number (Z‑contrast) | High‑Z elements appear brighter in HAADF-STEM |\n| Crystallinity / phase | Diffraction contrast in TEM |\n\nConsequently the written marks must differ chemically or structurally from the surrounding paper/substrate. This can be achieved in practice by:\n\n* depositing a thin metallic line (as done in e‑beam lithography),\n* using a polymer resist that cross‑links under exposure,\n* applying a conductive sputtered coat (Au/Pt) over the whole card so that the exposed regions retain different thicknesses.\n\nWithout such contrast the electron beam would simply wash out the signal (especially in a non‑conductive cardboard that charges badly).\n\n---\n\n### 4.   Practical considerations  \n\n| Issue | Effect & Mitigation |\n|-------|---------------------|\n| **Vacuum compatibility** | Many organic inks out‑gas; replace with inorganic pigments or metal films. |\n| **Radiation damage** | A low dose scan suffices because the goal is structural—not spectroscopic—imaging. |\n| **Field of view** | Modern scanners can stitch together thousands of frames; reading a full page would take minutes‑to‑hours, but is technically doable. |\n| **Sample preparation** | Thin (<100 nm) sections improve transmission TEM; otherwise a surface‑scanning SEM with backscatter detection works fine. |\n\nThese points make the experiment cumbersome, yet none constitute a fundamental barrier.\n\n---\n\n### 5.   Verdict  \n\nBecause the ultimate resolving power of an electron microscope (\\(\\lesssim 0.05\\;\\text{nm}\\)) vastly exceeds the minimum size of any realistically printable character on a postcard, **the text would indeed be observable and decipherable**—provided the markings generate adequate electron‑optical contrast and the specimen survives the necessary vacuum and irradiation conditions.\n\nIn other words, the limitation is not the microscope’s optics but rather the chemistry/materials used to encode the information.\n\n---  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\displaystyle \n\\text{Yes. An electron microscope can resolve and thus read ultra‑small lettering on a smooth postcard, }\n\\\\\n\\text{assuming the printed marks create sufficient contrast and withstand the EM environment.}\n}\n\\]"}

Reaction types:\n\n(1): p(projectile)+p(target) -> p + (p + nπ). Means after collision we have two systems: one intact proton (maybe either projectile or target depending on which side dissociates), plus another system consisting of a proton plus n pions. For part (a): target dissociates; so final state includes projectile unchanged as proton, and target becomes p+4π. So initial lab: projectile with kinetic energy such that center-of-mass enough to produce masses M_final = mass(proj proton) + mass(system B). System B minimal invariant mass equals sum of masses of its constituents at rest relative each other: Mp + n * m_pi . Since they can share momentum but threshold occurs when all final particles move together with same velocity i.e., overall CM motion only, no internal KE. In lab frame where target initially at rest, find minimal projectile energy needed to satisfy conservation of energy & momentum given these masses.\n\nGeneral formula for threshold beam energy in fixed-target experiment: Let s = (p1+p2)^2. At threshold, s_thr = (sum_i m_i)^2 where sum over final particle masses assuming they're moving collectively (i.e., zero relative momenta). Here final consists of two clusters: cluster A (intact proton) and cluster B (proton+4π). But since they could separate, still treat them as individual particles? Actually there are multiple particles: total N=1+(1+4)=6 particles. However at threshold they will all move collinearly with same velocity in CM frame, meaning their combined invariant mass squared equals (∑ m_i)^2. That's correct because if you consider all six particles individually, the total invariant mass is just sum of masses (since zero relative momentum). So s_thr = (M_total)^2 where M_total = (number_of_protons)*mp + n*m_π etc.\n\nThus for case (a): final has 2 protons + 4 π's => total mass M_tot = 2* mp + 4 * mπ.\n\nSimilarly for case (b): also same final composition (projectile dissociates, target remains proton). Still total same set: 2 protons + 4π. Wait difference maybe distribution between sides doesn't affect total mass. Indeed threshold depends only on total final mass irrespective of which side dissociated, provided both original protons remain present (one possibly excited). So parts (a) and (b) should give same E_min? Not exactly because kinematics differ due to which particle gets extra mass? Let's think: If projectile dissociates, then final contains a fast-moving multi-particle system from projectile direction, while target stays stationary perhaps? But threshold condition derived using invariants yields same required sqrt(s). However conversion to lab beam energy differs because s expression uses projectile energy and target at rest: s = m_p^2 + m_p^2 + 2 m_p E_lab (with c=1). Where E_lab is total energy of projectile (including rest mass). So solving for E_lab gives same value regardless of which side dissociates, because s only cares about total initial four-momentum. Therefore (a) and (b) identical thresholds. Yet problem likely expects different answers? Maybe they ask min energy for reaction 1 when target dissociates vs projectile dissociates - might indeed be same. Could double-check nuance: In diffraction, one proton emerges essentially untouched (elastic scattering) while other breaks up. Energy transferred limited? Might require more subtlety like requiring certain rapidity gap? Probably not; simple threshold calculation leads same result.\n\nNow (c): Both protons dissociate into p+4π each → final total: 2 protons + 8 pions. Total mass M_tot = 2 mp + 8 mπ.\n\nCompute numeric values.\n\nFirst compute constants:\nmp = 0.938 GeV\nmpi = 0.140 GeV\n\nCase (a,b):\nMtot_a = 2*0.938 + 4*0.14 = 1.876 + 0.56 = 2.436 GeV.\n\ns_thr = (2.436)^2 ≈ 5.934... let's calculate precisely: 2.436^2 = (2.4+0.036)^2 = 5.76 + 2*2.4*0.036 + 0.001296 =5.76+0.1728+0.0013≈5.9339 GeV^2.\n\nInitial s = m_p^2 + m_p^2 + 2 m_p E_beam (lab). Using units c=1. m_p^2 = (0.938)^2 = 0.879844 ~0.880 GeV^2.\n\nSo s_initial = 2*0.88 + 2*0.938*E = 1.759688 + 1.876 E.\n\nSet equal to s_thr:\n\n1.7597 + 1.876 E = 5.9339 ⇒ 1.876 E = 5.9339 - 1.7597 = 4.1742 ⇒ E = 4.1742 / 1.876 = approx 2.226 GeV.\n\nThat's total energy including rest mass of projectile. Kinetic energy T = E - m_p = 2.226 - 0.938 = 1.288 GeV.\n\nBut question asks \"incident proton energy E\". Likely means total energy (or kinetic?). Usually in labs they'd refer to kinetic energy. We'll specify both.\n\nCheck rounding: Compute more precise numbers.\n\nLet's do exact calculations quickly via mental?\n\nBetter use higher precision: mp=0.938272 (but given 0.938).

Let's compute accurately: 2400^2=5,760,000 ; add cross terms: 2*2400*36=172800 ; plus 36^2=1296 ; total 5,934,096. Scale factor 10^-6 => 5.934096 GeV^2.\n\nSubtract 1.759688 => 4.174408.\n\nDivide by 1.876 => 2.22596 GeV.\n\nHence E_incident,total = 2.226 GeV.

Compute: 3000^2=9,000,000 ; minus 2*3000*4=24,000 ; plus16 = 8,976,016 ×10^-6 = 8.976016 GeV^2.\n\nSet equality: 1.759688 + 1.876 E = 8.976016 ⇒ 1.876 E = 7.216328 ⇒ E = 7.216328/1.876 = 3.847...\n\nCalculate: 1.876*3.84 = 7.209..., remainder small. More accurate: divide: 7.216328 ÷ 1.876 = ?\n\nUse long division: 1.876 goes into 7.216 about 3.846. Multiply back: 1.876*3.846 = 1.876*(3 +0.846) = 5.628 + 1.587... wait compute: 1.876*0.846 = 1.876*846/1000 = (1.876*846)/1000. 1.876*800=1500.8; *40=75.04; *6=11.256; sum=1587.096; /1000=1.5871. Add 5.628 = 7.2151 close. Slightly low. Need 7.21633, diff 0.00123. Additional 0.00066 times coefficient adds ~0.00124. So E≈3.8467 GeV.\n\nThus total energy ≈3.85 GeV.

First scenario: target proton at rest, projectile proton incoming.\n\nUse invariant s = (p1+p2)^2 . Threshold when all final particles move together in CM frame i.e., minimal kinetic energy => they are at rest relative each other in COM; total momentum zero, energies just masses sum. So s_threshold = (2 m_p + M)^2 where m=m_p.\n\nInitial lab frame: target at rest, projectile energy E_lab (total energy) includes its rest mass: E = T+ m. Momentum p such that s = m^2 + m^2 + 2mE (since p_target=0). Actually formula: s = m^2 + m^2 + 2 m E_{lab}. Because four-momenta: P1=(E,momentum), P2=(m,0). Then s = m^2 + m^2 + 2 m E.\n\nSet equal to (2m+M)^2.\n\nThus solve for E:\n\n2 m E + 2 m^2 = (2m+M)^2 → 2 m E = (2m+M)^2 - 2 m^2.\n\nCompute RHS: expand (2m+M)^2 = 4 m^2 +4 m M + M^2. Subtract 2 m^2 gives = 2 m^2 +4 m M + M^2.\n\nSo E = [2 m^2 +4 m M + M^2] / (2 m) = (2 m^2)/(2m)+ (4 m M)/(2m)+(M^2)/(2m)= m + 2 M + M^2/(2m).\n\nBut note E is total energy of incident proton. Kinetic energy needed: T = E - m = 2 M + M^2/(2m).\n\nTherefore minimum kinetic energy required: \\(T_{\\text{min}} = 2M + \\frac{M^{2}}{2m}\\).\n\nNow second part: both protons approach each other with equal velocities magnitude v in center-of-mass symmetric case. In lab we can consider centre-of-mass frame already because momenta cancel. The total available energy sqrt(s) equals 2γ m (each's total energy). Need √s >= 2m + M. Since initial system consists only of two protons, their combined invariant mass squared s = (P1+P2)^2 = 2 m^2 + 2(E_1 E_2 - p_1·p_2). For opposite directions same speed, dot product negative: p1 = -p2 so p1·p2 = -|p|^2. Also E1=E2=γ m. Thus s = 2 m^2 + 2(γ^2 m^2 + |p|^2 )? Wait compute: E1E2 - p1·p2 = γ^2 m^2 - (-p^2)?? Actually p1·p2 = vector dot product = -p^2 since opposite direction. So minus sign yields plus: E1E2 - p1·p2 = γ^2 m^2 + p^2. But relation: γ^2 m^2 - p^2 = m^2 (from relativistic identity). Therefore γ^2 m^2 + p^2 = 2γ^2 m^2 - m^2. Let's verify using python symbolic maybe but easier: from γ^2 = 1/(1-β^2); p = γ β m. Compute γ^2 m^2 + p^2 = γ^2 m^2 + γ^2 β^2 m^2 = γ^2 m^2 (1+β^2) = γ^2 m^2 (1+β^2). Not simple.\n\nAlternative method: In CM frame total energy = 2γ m. That's correct because each contributes γ m. So √s = 2γ m. Set equality: 2γ m = 2m + M ⇒ γ = 1 + M/(2m). Hence kinetic energy per proton: T_per = (γ-1)m = m * (M/(2m)) = M/2. Wait check: γ-1 = M/(2m). Multiply by m gives T=M/2. However there may also be extra term due to relativity? Let's double-check via invariants.\n\nGiven requirement √s ≥ 2m+M. With equal speeds opposite, √s = 2γ m indeed. Derivation: total four-momentum: (E_total, 0) where E_total = 2γ m. Its square: s = (2γ m)^2 = 4γ^2 m^2. Indeed that's consistent with earlier expression? Should match previous general formula: s = 2m^2 + 2(E1E2 - p1·p2). Plug numbers: E1=E2=γ m, p1=-p2, magnitude p = γ β m. Then p1·p2 = -p^2 = -(γ^2 β^2 m^2). So E1E2 - p1·p2 = γ^2 m^2 + γ^2 β^2 m^2 = γ^2 m^2 (1+β^2). Then s = 2m^2 + 2γ^2 m^2 (1+β^2) = 2m^2 + 2γ^2 m^2 + 2γ^2 β^2 m^2 = 2m^2 + 2γ^2 m^2 + 2(γ^2-1) m^2 (using γ^2 β^2 = γ^2 -1). Sum = 2m^2 + 2γ^2 m^2 + 2γ^2 m^2 -2 m^2 = 4γ^2 m^2. Good matches.\n\nHence condition leads to γ = 1 + M/(2m). So kinetic energy per proton = (γ-1)m = M/2. Total kinetic energy of both protons = M.\n\nAlternatively ask \"corresponding energy\" meaning perhaps kinetic energy of each or total?

Part (a): list natural linewidth, Doppler broadening due to temperature, collisional (pressure) broadening from high density, Stark broadening maybe negligible, Zeeman splitting/broadening due to magnetic fields, instrumental etc. Also mention fine structure, hyperfine but not relevant.\n\nPart (b): Choose e.g., Doppler broadening because T=20 eV corresponds to about 2.32×10^5 K? Actually k_B * T = 20 eV => T ≈ 20*11604 K/eV = 232080 K. That's huge; compute velocity distribution for carbon ions mass m_C ~ 12 amu = 12*1.66E-27 kg = 1.992E-26 kg. Thermal speed v_th = sqrt(2kT/m). Compute Δλ/λ = v/c . So Δλ_Doppler = λ*(v_rms)/c where v_rms = sqrt(kT/m). Use root mean square along line-of-sight: sqrt(kT/m). Let's compute numeric:\n\nk = 8.61733e-5 eV/K -> But we already have energy directly: kT = 20 eV = 20*1.602e-19 J = 3.204e-18 J.\n\nSo v_rms = sqrt(kT / m) = sqrt(3.204e-18 / 1.99e-26)= sqrt(1.61e8)=~12690 m/s. Wait check factor: Actually that's sqrt(1.6e8) = 1.265e4 m/s indeed.\n\nThen fractional doppler shift = v/c = 1.265e4 / 3e8 = 4.22e-5. Multiply λ=500 nm gives Δλ≈21 pm (0.021 nm). That is larger than natural width (~10^-5 nm?). Good.\n\nAlternatively pressure broadening: collision frequency ν_coll = n σ v_rel ; cross-section typical atomic radius squared ~ (1 Å)^2 = 1e-20 m². With n=1e24, v~1e4 m/s → ν≈1e24*1e-20*1e4=1e8 s⁻¹ giving Lorentzian FWHM Δν = ν/(2π) ≈ 1.6e7 Hz corresponding wavelength Δλ = (λ^2 / c)*Δν = (5e-7)^2/3e8 *1.6e7 = (2.5e-13)/(3e8)*1.6e7?? let's compute: λ^2 = 2.5e-13 m^2. Divide by c: 2.5e-13 / 3e8 = 8.33e-22 s·m. Times Δν 1.6e7 yields 1.33e-14 m = 0.013 pm, much smaller than Doppler. Magnetic Zeeman splitting: ΔE = μ_B g B m_J. For B=1 T, μ_B=9.274e-24 J/T, so ΔE≈9.3e-24 J per unit mJ. Convert to wavelength shift: Δλ = λ^2 /(hc) ΔE. Compute λ^2/hc = (2.5e-13)/(6.626e-34*3e8)=2.5e-13 /1.9878e-25 =1.258e12 m/J. Multiply by ΔE ~9e-24 => Δλ≈1.13e-11 m = 0.011 pm. Small compared to Doppler.\n\nThus dominant mechanism likely Doppler.

Any residual charge would quickly attract opposite charges from surrounding plasma, neutralising the body.\n\n3. **Consequences of neutrality:**  \n   If the Earth and the Moon each had a net charge of just one coulomb (an astronomically tiny fraction compared with the number of elementary charges present), the resulting electrostatic attraction would already exceed the lunar orbital gravitational pull:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{F_{\\text{elec}}}{F_{\\text{grav}}}\n      = \\frac{k_e |q_E q_M|}\n             {G M_E M_M }\n        \\approx \\frac{8.99\\times10^{9}(1\\;\\text C)^2}\n                     {6.67\\times10^{-11}(5.97\\times10^{24})(7.35\\times10^{22})}\n        \\sim 10^{23}.\n   \\]\n   Hence, unless the net charges are effectively zero, the electrostatic term would dominate completely—contrary to observations.\n\n4. **Why we “ignore” the electrostatic force:**  \n   Because the Earth and the Moon possess negligible net charge, the product \\(q_E q_M\\) is essentially zero, making \\(F_{\\text{elec}}\\) vanishingly small compared with the measured gravitational force. This is not due to some special tidal cancellation or merely being numerically smaller under typical conditions; it stems fundamentally from electrical neutrality.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate justification among the given options is:\n\n> **(b) because the bodies are electrically neutral.**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{(b)}}\n\\]"}

Show if possible/impossible.\n\na) Photon hits stationary e-, transfers all energy => resulting electron would have momentum equal to photon's initial momentum; but initially total momentum = p_photon +0 . After absorption, electron has same momentum as before? Actually after absorbing photon, electron's momentum equals original photon momentum. Energy: initial E=Eγ+ m_ec^2 ; final electron kinetic plus rest mass = sqrt(p^2c^2+m_e^2 c^4). Need check if equality can hold with p = h/λ etc. Use invariant s maybe. Compute: For photon of energy ε, momentum magnitude ε/c. Initial four-momenta sum squared: (p_γ + p_e)^2 = m_e^2 c^2 + 2 p_γ·p_e . Since electron at rest, dot product zero except time component: p_γ·p_e = (ε/c)(m_ec). So invariant M^2 = m_e^2 c^2 + 2 ε m_e /c *?? Let's compute properly: Four-vector: photon (ε/c , ε n̂ /c ), electron (m_ec , 0 ). Sum square: (ε/c + m_ec )^2 - (ε n̂ /c)^2 = (ε/c)^2 + 2 ε m_e + m_e^2 c^2 - (ε/c)^2 = m_e^2 c^2 + 2 ε m_e . This should equal final electron's invariant mass squared which is just m_e^2 c^2 (since it's still electron). But we get extra term unless ε=0. Therefore not allowed. Equivalent argument: can't conserve both energy & momentum simultaneously because photon cannot be absorbed alone by free electron – needs another particle/nucleus.\n\nThus impossible.\n\nb) Single photon -> e⁺e⁻ in vacuum. Conservation of four-momentum again: initial invariant mass zero (photon null vector). Final system two massive particles have non-zero invariant mass >0. Not possible. Also need presence of third body to take away momentum. In field near nucleus pair production occurs.\n\nImpossible.\n\nc) Fast positron collides with stationary electron produce one photon. Consider charges: net charge zero initial, photon neutral so okay. Check four-momentum: initial total momentum ≠ zero generally (positron moving), final photon carries that momentum, fine. However consider invariants: initial invariant mass squared = (p_{e+}+p_{e-})^2 = m_e^2c^2 + m_e^2c^2 + 2 p_{e+}\\cdot p_{e-}. With electron at rest, p_{e-}= (m_ec,0); positron with energy E+, momentum p+. Then invariant = 2 m_e^2 c^2 + 2(E+/c)(m_ec) - 2 p+·0 = 2 m_e^2 c^2 + 2 m_e E+. That's >0. Final photon invariant mass zero. Can't match. Thus impossible. Alternatively use center-of-mass frame where total momentum zero requires two photons due to angular momentum parity?

Reaction K− + p → Λ⁰ + π⁺ + π⁻ . Invariant mass of Λπ⁺ peaks at 1385 MeV, width 50 MeV; named Y₁*. Also Λπ⁻ invariant mass also shows similar peak. So we have resonance decaying into Λ plus pion (charged). Determine strangeness S, hypercharge Y, isospin I.\n\nFirst recall quantum numbers:\n\nΛ⁰ has quark content uds, strangeness -1 (since s quark gives S = –1), baryon number B=1, charge Q=0, hypercharge Y = B + S = 1 + (-1)=0. Isospin I=0 (singlet).\n\nPion π⁺ (u anti-d): S=0, B=0, Y=B+S=0, I=1, I3=+1.\n\nSimilarly π⁻: I3=-1.\n\nNow Y* resonances observed as Σ(1385)? Actually known particle Σ*(1385) which decays to Λπ. Indeed Σ(1385)^+, Σ(1385)^0 etc. But here they see both Λπ⁺ and Λπ⁻ peaks implying charged states maybe Σ*+. Wait: Λπ⁺ would give total charge +1, so parent Y* must have charge +1. Similarly Λπ⁻ gives charge -1 => parent charge -1. That suggests there are two members of an isotriplet: charges +1,0,-1 perhaps. Since both ± appear, likely it's Σ(1385) with I=1. Hypercharge? For Σ's, Y = 0? Let's compute: Σ hyperons have composition like uus (Σ+) , uds (Σ0), dds (Σ-) ; each contains one strange quark -> S = -1, B=1 => Y = B+S = 0. Yes Σ hyperons have Y=0. Strangeness S = -1. So Y* should have S = -1, Y = 0, I = 1 (triplet). That's part (a).\n\nCheck consistency: Decay Λ (I=0) + π (I=1) can combine to overall I = 1 (or possibly 1?). Coupling I=0 ⊗ 1 yields only I=1. Thus parent must have I=1 indeed.\n\nThus answers: S = -1, Y = 0, I = 1.\n\nPart (b): They say evidence indicates that the product Λ⁰ + π⁺ from a Y₁* is in a relative p-state of orbital angular momentum L = 1. Need possible J values given spins of constituents: Spin of Λ⁰ is ½, spin of pion is 0. Total spin S_total = ½ (just from Lambda). Combine with orbital L=1 to get total J = |L-S| ... L+S i.e., J = ½ or ³/₂? Actually coupling j = L⊕S where S=½, L=1 leads to J = 1±½ = ½ or 3/2. So possible J = ½ or 3/2.\n\nParity: Intrinsic parities P_int(Lambda)=+, pi = -. Product intrinsic parity = (+)(-) = -. Orbital contribution factor (-1)^L = (-1)^1 = -1. Overall parity of system = product * (-1)^L = (-)*( - ) = +. This equals parity of initial resonance if it decays strongly conserving parity. Therefore Y* parity = + .\n\nSo J^P possibilities: ½⁺ or 3/2⁺.\n\nBut note known Σ(1385) has J^P = 3/2⁺. However our analysis says could be either. Additional info may favor 3/2 due to width pattern but not required.\n\nThus answer: J = 1/2 or 3/2, positive parity.\n\nPart (c): Other strong decay modes expected: Since Y* has S=-1, Y=0, I=1 triplet, allowed strong decays conserve strangeness, isospin, etc. Main channel is Λπ (observed). Could also decay to N K (nucleon + kaon) because those preserve S? Check: Kaon carries S = +1 (for K⁺ u\\bar{s}) or K⁰ d\\bar{s}. To keep net S = -1, final state must contain another hadron with S = -1? Wait nucleon has S=0, kaon has S=+1, sum S=+1, not match. Alternatively antikaon (\\(\\overline{K}\\)) has S = -1. Strong decays often include Σπ, N\\bar{K}? Actually Σ(1385) decays dominantly to Λπ (~88%) and Σπ (~12%). Let’s think: Our resonance Y* is Σ(1385); other possible decays: Σπ (i.e., Σ + π) since Σ (I=1, S=-1) plus pion (S=0) still S=-1. Charge combinations consistent. Also maybe N \\bar{K}: e.g., Σ*→N \\bar{K}, where \\bar{K} (e.g., K̅⁰ or K⁻) has S = -1, nucleon S=0 giving total S=-1. Mass threshold: m_N ≈938 MeV, m_K≈494 MeV, sum ~1432 >1385, above resonance mass, thus kinematically forbidden (mass too low). So cannot decay to NK-bar because insufficient phase space. Another possibility Δπ? Not relevant.\n\nTherefore main strong decay mode besides Λπ is Σπ (with various charge combos). Branching ratio small due to limited phase space? Known branching fractions: Σ(1385) → Λπ about 87%, Σπ about 11% (maybe via virtual). So answer: Expect Σπ decays (both charged variants) as additional strong modes; no others open energetically.\n\nThus produce answer accordingly.\n\nProvide final boxed expression summarizing results.\n\nLet's craft nicely.\n\nassistantfinal**(a)   Quantum‑numbers of \\(Y_{1}^{*}\\)**  \n\nThe resonance appears in the invariant–mass spectra  \n\\( \\Lambda^{0}+ \\pi^{+}\\) **and** \\( \\Lambda^{0}+ \\pi^{-}\\).\nHence the resonance must carry the same strangeness as the \\(\\Lambda ^0\\)\n(and opposite sign to the kaon produced in the primary reaction):\n\n\\[\nS(Y_{1}^{*}) = S(\\Lambda^{0}) = -1 .\n\\]\n\nHypercharge is defined as \\(Y = B+S\\) (with baryon number \\(B=1\\) for all\nhyperons),\n\n\\[\nY(Y_{1}^{*}) = 1+(-1)=0 .\n\\]\n\nIsospin follows from the fact that the decay products couple as  \n\n\\[\nI_{\\Lambda}=0,\\qquad I_{\\pi}=1\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\n{\\bf 0}\\otimes {\\bf 1}= {\\bf 1}.\n\\]\n\nSince the resonance is seen both in the \\(\\Lambda\\pi^{+}\\) and \n\\(\\Lambda\\pi^{-}\\) channels, it belongs to an isotriplet,\nso  \n\n\\[\nI(Y_{1}^{*}) = 1 .\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**(b)   Possible spin \\(J\\) and intrinsic parity**\n\nIn the decay \\(Y_{1}^{*}\\to\\Lambda^{0}\\pi^{+}\\) the relative orbital\nangular momentum between the two daughters is indicated experimentally\nto be a **p‑wave**, i.e.  \n\n\\[\nL = 1 .\n\\]\n\nSpin of the daughter particles:\n\\[\ns_\\Lambda=\\tfrac12 ,\\qquad s_{\\pi}=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad\nS=s_\\Lambda = \\tfrac12 .\n\\]\n\nCoupling \\(L=1\\) with \\(S=\\tfrac12\\) gives\n\n\\[\nJ = |L-S|\\,,\\,L+S = \\Bigl|1-\\tfrac12\\Bigr|,\\;1+\\tfrac12\n          = \\boxed{\\tfrac12\\text{ or }\\tfrac32 } .\n\\]\n\nIntrinsic parities:   \n\\(P(\\Lambda^{0}) = +\\) , \\(P(\\pi^{+}) = -\\).\n\nFor a two‑body system the overall parity is  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\rm fin}=P(\\Lambda)\\,P(\\pi)\\,(-1)^{L}\n            =(+)(-)(-1)^{1}=+ .\n\\]\n\nStrong interactions conserve parity, therefore  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{P(Y_{1}^{*}) = + } .\n\\]\n\nConsequently the admissible \\(J^{P}\\) assignments are  \n\n\\[\nJ^{P}= \\frac12^{+}\\;\\; \\hbox{or}\\;\\; \\frac32^{+}.\n\\]\n\n(The well‑known \\(\\Sigma(1385)\\) corresponds to the latter.)\n\n---\n\n**(c)   Other possible strong decay modes**\n\nA strong decay must conserve baryon number, strangeness, electric charge\nand isospin, and must be kinematically allowed (the resonance mass is\n~1385 MeV).\n\nWith \\(S=-1\\) and \\(Y=0\\) the following two‑body channels satisfy the\nquantum‑number constraints:\n\n| Final state | Threshold (MeV) |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| \\(\\Lambda\\pi\\)      | \\(1116+140\\simeq1256\\) |\n| \\(\\Sigma\\pi\\)       | \\(1193+140\\simeq1333\\) |\n\nBoth lie below 1385 MeV, hence they are allowed.  \nThe dominant observed mode is \\(\\Lambda\\pi\\); the secondary strong mode\nexpected is \\(\\Sigma\\pi\\) (all charge combinations belonging to the\nisotriplet).\n\nDecays such as \\(N\\bar K\\) (\\(N\\!K\\)-antikaon) require a combined mass\n\\(\\gtrsim 938+495\\approx 1430\\) MeV, exceeding the resonance mass, so they\nare **kinematically closed**.

Actually general formula: G = C*(-1)^I where C is intrinsic charge conjugation for neutral member. Since π0 has C= +1? Wait π0 is pseudoscalar, C = +1? Actually π0 → γγ so C=+1. So G(π)=(-1)^{I}= -1^1 = -1 times C? Let's recall standard result: Pion have G=-1. Indeed all three pions have G = -1. For n-pion system, overall G = (-1)^n * (-1)^{L}? Need product rule: G_total = ∏ Gi * (-1)^L? The orbital angular momentum between identical bosons contributes factor (-1)^L due to exchange symmetry? In literature: G|ππ> = (+1) if L even? Actually two-pion system can have G = (+1)^(?) Let’s derive: Each pion has G=-1. Two-pion combined: G_total = (-1)^2 * (-1)^L = (+1)*(-1)^L . Because when swapping two pions you get phase (-1)^L from spatial wavefunction. But also isospin coupling may affect sign. Standard results: For two-pion system, G = (-1)^I_L?? Hmm known that G-parity selection rules forbid certain decays like ω→π⁰π⁺π⁻ allowed because G_ω = -1? Actually ω has G = -1? Check: ω (I=0) has C = -1, thus G = C*(-1)^I = -1*1 = -1.

So around 144.8 MeV. Let's compute accurately using calculator mental: 271,485/1876.\n\nCompute 1876*144 = 270,144. Remainder 1,341. Additional fraction 1341/1876≈0.715. So approx 144.72 MeV.\n\nThus threshold photon energy ~145 MeV.\n\nCheck typical value known: For π⁰ production threshold ~150 MeV. Good.\n\nSo answer (a): ~145 MeV.\n\nPart (b): Now we consider high-energy proton colliding head-on with low-energy CMB photon ε = 0.001 eV = 10^{-3} eV. Convert to MeV: 1 eV = 1e-6 MeV, thus 0.001 eV = 1×10^-3 eV = 1×10^-9 MeV = 1e-9 MeV. Actually 1 eV = 1.602e-13 J but conversion not needed. So epsilon = 10^{-9} MeV.\n\nIn center-of-mass invariant s = (p_proton + k_photon)^2. Threshold occurs when sqrt(s)_thr = m_p + m_π (the combined mass of final state). Since final also includes proton, actually two-particle final: proton + pi0. At threshold they move together, so s_thr = (m_p + m_π)^2.\n\nGiven incoming photon four-momentum: (ε, ε direction), proton energy Ep, momentum pc (approx Ep because high). Use invariants: s = m_p^2 + 2 m_p ε' where ε' is photon energy in proton rest frame (or equivalently s = m_p^2 + 2 E_p ε (1 - cosθ)), for head-on θ =180°, cosθ=-1, then factor (1 - (-1)) =2, giving s = m_p^2 + 4 E_p ε .\n\nBut careful: general formula: s = m_p^2 + 2 E_p ε (1 - β cosθ)?? Wait derive: Four vectors: Proton: (E_p, p_vec). Photon: (ε, ε n̂). Then s = m_p^2 + 2(E_p ε - p·k). With |k|=ε (c=1). For head-on, p opposite direction to photon, so dot product p·k = -|p| ε. Thus s = m_p^2 + 2 ε (E_p + |p| ). For ultra-relativistic proton, |p| ≈ E_p (neglect mass). So s ≈ m_p^2 + 4 ε E_p.\n\nYes.\n\nSet s_thr = (m_p + m_π)^2.\n\nTherefore solve for E_p_min:\n\nE_p_min = [(m_p + m_π)^2 - m_p^2] / (4 ε).\n\nThe numerator we already computed earlier: Δ = 271,485 MeV².\n\nNow denominator: 4 ε = 4 × 1e-9 MeV = 4e-9 MeV.\n\nHence E_p_min = 271,485 MeV² / 4e-9 MeV = 6.787125e13 MeV.\n\nConvert to eV or GeV: 1 MeV = 10^6 eV, so multiply: 6.79e13 MeV = 6.79e19 eV = 67.9 EeV? Wait exaelectronvolt = 10^18 eV. So it's 6.8×10¹⁹ eV = 68 EeV. That's near GZK cut-off (~5×10^{19} eV). Indeed matches expectation.\n\nLet's present as roughly 7×10^{19} eV.\n\nAlternatively express in TeV: 1 TeV = 10³ GeV = 10^6 MeV. So dividing: 6.8e13 MeV / 1e6 = 6.8e7 TeV = 6.8×10^7 TeV.\n\nBetter give in units of PeV etc: 1 PeV = 10^15 eV = 10^9 MeV. So 6.8e13 MeV = 6.8e4 PeV = 68,000 PeV.\n\nAnyway.\n\nPart (c): Implications: Cosmic rays protons above ~5×10^{19} eV interact with CMB photons producing pions, leading to energy loss over cosmological distances – Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff. Therefore observed CR spectrum should show suppression beyond ~50 EeV due to these interactions; sources must be relatively nearby (<~100 Mpc). Also composition may shift.\n\nProvide brief speculation.\n\nNow craft final answer with LaTeX boxed results.\n\nMake sure include steps explanation.\n\nProceed.assistantfinal**(a)   Laboratory‑frame threshold**\n\nFor a photon hitting a stationary proton  \n\n\\[\n\\gamma(k)+p(p)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\pi ^0(q)+p(p')\n\\]\n\nthe Mandelstam variable \\(s=(p+k)^2\\) must equal the squared invariant mass of the\nfinal state taken at its lowest possible value (both products moving together):\n\n\\[\ns_{\\text {thr}} =(M_{p}+M_{\\pi})^{2}.\n\\]\n\nWith the target proton at rest (\\(p^\\mu=(M_{p},\\,{\\bf 0})\\))\n\n\\[\ns=M_{p}^{2}+2M_{p}\\,\\varepsilon_\\gamma ,\n\\qquad \n\\varepsilon_\\gamma\\equiv {\\rm photon\\;energy\\;(lab)} .\n\\]\n\nSetting \\(s=s_{\\text {thr}}\\),\n\n\\[\nM_{p}^{2}+2M_{p}\\,\\varepsilon_{\\gamma}^{\\;(\\mathrm{thr})}\n      =(M_{p}+M_{\\pi })^{2},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\n\\varepsilon_{\\gamma}^{\\;(\\mathrm{thr})}=%\n\\frac{(M_{p}+M_{\\pi})^{2}-M_{p}^{2}}\n     {2M_{p}}\n       } .\n\\]\n\nInsert the numerical values  \n\\(M_{p}=938\\;\\text{MeV},\\;M_{\\pi}=135\\;\\text{MeV}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(M_{p}+M_{\\pi})^{2}&=(938+135)^{2}=1073^{2}=1.15133\\times10^{6}\\;\\text{MeV}^{2},\\\\\nM_{p}^{2}&=938^{2}=8.79844\\times10^{5}\\;\\text{MeV}^{2},\\\\[2mm]\n\\Delta&=1.15133\\times10^{6}-8.79844\\times10^{5}=2.71485\\times10^{5}\\;\\text{MeV}^{2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_{\\gamma}^{\\;(\\mathrm{thr})}\n=\\frac{2.71485\\times10^{5}}{2\\times938}\n\\simeq 1.45\\times10^{2}\\;\\text{MeV}.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon_{\\gamma}^{\\;(\\mathrm{thr})}\\approx 1.4\\times10^{2}\\;\\text{MeV}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**(b)   Head‑on collision with a CMB photon**\n\nA CMB photon has mean energy  \n\n\\[\n\\epsilon =0.001\\;\\text{eV}=10^{-9}\\;\\text{MeV}.\n\\]\n\nLet the incident proton have laboratory energy \\(E_{p}\\gg M_{p}\\).\nFor a head‑on encounter (\\(\\theta =180^{\\circ}\\))\n\n\\[\ns = M_{p}^{2}+2\\bigl[E_{p}\\epsilon-\\mathbf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathbf{k}\\bigr]\n    =M_{p}^{2}+2\\epsilon\\,(E_{p}+|\\mathbf{p}| )\n    \\simeq M_{p}^{2}+4\\epsilon\\,E_{p},\n\\]\n\n(the approximation uses \\(|\\mathbf{p}|\\simeq E_{p}\\) for ultrarelativistic protons).\n\nAt threshold \\(s=(M_{p}+M_{\\pi})^{2}\\); therefore\n\n\\[\n4\\epsilon\\,E_{p}^{\\;(\\mathrm{thr})}\n        =(M_{p}+M_{\\pi})^{2}-M_{p}^{2}\n        =\\Delta =2.71485\\times10^{5}\\;\\text{MeV}^{2},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\nE_{p}^{\\;(\\mathrm{thr})}= \\frac{\\Delta}{4\\epsilon}\n          =\\frac{2.71485\\times10^{5}\\;\\text{MeV}^{2}}\n                 {4\\times10^{-9}\\;\\text{MeV}}\n          \\approx 6.8\\times10^{13}\\;\\text{MeV}. }\n\\]\n\nConverting,\n\n\\[\nE_{p}^{\\;(\\mathrm{thr})}\\approx 6.8\\times10^{19}\\;\\text{eV}\n                         \\; \\Bigl(\\sim 70\\;\\text{EeV}\\Bigr)\n                         \\; (=6.8\\times10^{7}\\;\\text{TeV}). \n\\]\n\n---\n\n**(c)   Consequence for the cosmic‑ray spectrum**\n\nProtons whose energies exceed \\(\\sim 5\\!-\\!7\\times10^{19}\\) eV can produce a\nneutral pion through collisions with the ubiquitous 3 K microwave background.\nEach such interaction removes a sizable fraction of the proton’s kinetic\nenergy, limiting how far it can travel before being degraded below the\nthreshold.

In lab frame, proper lifetime τ_0 relates via mean path length λ = βγcτ_0 . But here it's just one event with travel distance d; but they ask \"time that the particle lived in its own rest frame\".

For each specific channel i with partial width Γ_i = B_i Γ_total where B_i is branching ratio. Lifetime for that channel effective distribution has same overall exponent because probability per unit time to decay via any channel is constant; however conditional on decaying through particular mode, the waiting-time distribution still exponential with same τ_total, independent of branching ratio. However number of events scales with BR. So both modes have identical shape (same mean), only relative frequencies differ. Expected distribution for mode with 1% will be lower amplitude (by factor 0.01) compared to 40%, but normalized shapes coincide.\n\nIf you look at conditional distribution given that it decayed via that mode, then also same exponential with same τ.

Explain.", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to answer each part clearly, providing reasoning.\n\nPart (a): Two-body decay π⁺ → μ⁺ ν₁. In rest frame of pion, muon energy fixed: E*μ = (mπ² + mμ²)/ (2 mπ). Momentum magnitude p*_μ = λ^{1/2}(mπ²,mμ²,0)/(2 mπ)= ((mπ² - mμ²))/(2 mπ). For moving pion with lab momentum p >> masses, we boost along direction of motion; muon's momentum varies between min and max depending on emission angle θ* relative to boost direction. Use Lorentz transformation: In lab frame, longitudinal component: p_{||}=γ(p_* cosθ* + βE_*), transverse unchanged: p_T= p_* sinθ*. Magnitude squared: p_lab² = γ²(p_* cosθ* + βE_*)² + p_*² sin²θ*. Minimum when cosθ*=-1 (backward); maximum when cosθ*=+1 (forward).\n\nGiven high-energy limit p>>mπ so β≈1, γ ≈ p/mπ (since total energy ~ sqrt(p²+mπ²) ≈ p + mπ²/(2p)). Approximate using ultrarelativistic boost.\n\nCompute expressions: Let Eπ = √(p² + mπ²) ≈ p + mπ²/(2p). Then γ = Eπ / mπ ; β = p/Eπ ≈ 1 - mπ²/(2p²). But can approximate β≈1.\n\nThen forward case: p_max ≈ γ (p_* + β E_*) . Since β~1, approx p_*+E_* . Actually more precisely: p_max ≈ γ (p_* + β E_* ) because cosθ*=1 gives term inside parentheses. With β≈1 => p_*+E_* .\n\nSimilarly backward: p_min ≈ γ (-p_* + β E_* ). Using β≈1 -> -p_* + E_* . Must ensure positivity; since E_* > p_* (because mass nonzero), result positive.\n\nNow compute p_* and E_* values from two-body decay: \n\nE_* = (mπ² + mμ²)/(2 mπ)\np_* = (mπ² - mμ²)/(2 mπ)\n\nThus:\nE_* ± p_* = [(mπ² + mμ²) ± (mπ² - mμ²)] /(2 mπ) = [ (mπ² + mμ²)+(mπ² - mμ²) ]/(2 mπ) = (2 mπ²)/(2 mπ) = mπ   for plus sign,\nAnd for minus: (mπ² + mμ²)-(mπ² - mμ²) = 2 mμ² ⇒ (2 mμ²)/(2 mπ) = mμ² / mπ.\n\nSo:\nE_* + p_* = mπ\nE_* - p_* = mμ² / mπ\n\nTherefore:\np_max ≈ γ * mπ = (Eπ / mπ)* mπ = Eπ ≈ p (plus small correction).\np_min ≈ γ * (mμ² / mπ) = (Eπ / mπ)*(mμ² / mπ) = Eπ * (mμ² / mπ²) ≈ p * (mμ² / mπ²) (neglect corrections O(mπ²/p²)).\n\nHence answers: p_max ≈ p , p_min ≈ p * (m_µ² / m_π²). Could also include leading order corrections maybe add factor (1 - ...). So write as:\n\n\\(p_{\\text{max}}\\simeq p\\),\n\n\\(p_{\\text{min}}\\simeq p\\,\\frac{m_\\mu^2}{m_\\pi^2}\\).\n\nThat's part (a).\n\nPart (b): Neutrino produced in π decay is left-handed (negative helicity) due to V–A weak interaction. Pion spin zero initial state, angular momentum conservation requires sum of spins/helicities of outgoing particles equal zero (in CM?). In pion rest frame, neutrino moves opposite muon if emitted back-to-back. Helicity of neutrino is -½ (left-handed). Muon must carry opposite projection to conserve total J_z =0. However muon massive, its helicity not strictly forced but in ultra-relativistic limit it will be mostly right-handed (+). Because chirality coupling selects left-chiral lepton, which for antilepton (positively charged?) Wait here it's µ+, i.e., anti-muon (positive charge). Weak current couples to left-handed particle or right-handed antiparticle? Charged-current Lagrangian involves left-handed doublets: \\( (\\nu_\\ell, \\ell)_L\\). That means the charged lepton field appears as left-handed component. For production of ℓ⁺ (antiparticle), you get right-handed chirality (i.e., left-handed antiparticle corresponds to right-handed helicity for relativistic). Let's think: In π⁺→µ⁺ν_µ, the µ⁺ is an antimuon, which is created via the conjugate of left-handed muon field, giving a right-handed chiral state. Therefore its helicity tends to be + (right-handed). Thus answer: muon helicity is + (positive helicity). More explicitly: Since ν₁ has h = –1, muon must have h = +1 to conserve angular momentum (spin-zero pion). So answer: Positive helicity.\n\nPart (c): Decay µ⁺ → e⁺ ν₂ \\(\\bar\\nu_3\\). Here ν₂ (neutrino) is left-handed (h = – ), \\(\\bar\\nu_3\\) is right-handed (h = +). Total angular momentum before decay: muon had +1 helicity (approx). After decay, sum of helicities should match (ignoring orbital angular momentum). Assuming collinear momenta (highly boosted), helicities add algebraically. We have contributions: ν₂ : –1, \\(\\bar\\nu_3\\): +1, leaving net 0 from neutrinos. To conserve overall +1, the positron must carry +1 helicity. Hence positron helicity is + (right-handed). This matches known suppression of π→e decay because e⁺ would need wrong helicity.\n\nThus answer: Positron helicity is + (right‑handed).\n\nPart (d): Conserved quantum number is Lepton family numbers: muon lepton number \\(L_\\mu\\) and electron lepton number \\(L_e\\). Specifically, ν₁ (the muon-type neutrino) carries muon lepton number +1, while \\(\\bar\\nu_3\\) (anti-electron-neutrino) carries electron lepton number –1 etc. So association indicated by separate lepton flavor numbers.\n\nAnswer: Muon lepton number \\(L_\\mu\\) associates ν₁ with muon; Electron lepton number \\(L_e\\) associates \\(\\bar\\nu_3\\) (or ν₂) with electron.\n\nPart (e): Explanation of why π→e ν suppressed despite phase space similarity. It's helicity suppression due to V−A structure and required helicity flip for light electron. Rate proportional to (m_l)^2 (lepton mass squared) because amplitude contains factor m_l from Dirac spinor contraction after projecting onto correct chirality. Since m_e << m_μ, ratio Γ(π→e ν)/Γ(π→μ ν) ≈ (m_e^2 / m_μ^2)( (m_π^2 - m_e^2)^2 / (m_π^2 - m_μ^2)^2 ) ≈ 1.23×10^{-4}. That's about 10^-4 difference.

In lab frame moving with speed v, observed lifetime τ = γ τ0 where γ=1/√(1−β^2), β=v/c.\n\nIn travel distance L=10 m, fraction decayed f=0.10 i.e., probability that a given particle survives after traveling distance L equals exp(-t_lab / τ) = e^{-L/(v τ)}? Actually number N(t)=N0 e^{-t/τ}. After traveling distance L, t = L/v (lab time). So surviving fraction = e^{ - L/(v τ)} . Decay fraction = 1 - survival = 0.10 => survival = 0.90.\n\nThus:\n\nexp[- L /(v τ)] = 0.9 → L/(v τ) = -ln 0.9 ≈ 0.1053605.\n\nSo we have relation between v and γ via τ = γ τ0.\n\nPlug: L/(v γ τ0 ) = ln(1/0.9) ~0.10536.\n\nLet’s denote βc = v; so v = β c.\n\nThen equation: L/(β c γ τ0) = 0.10536.\n\nRecall γ = 1/sqrt(1-β²).\n\nTherefore compute unknown β from:\n\nL / (β c τ0 * γ) = 0.10536 -> rearrange:\n\nβ γ = L / (0.10536 c τ0)\n\nCompute RHS numeric:\n\nL = 10 m,\nc = 3×10⁸ m/s,\nτ0 = 2.6 ×10^-8 s,\n\nDenominator: 0.10536 * c * τ0 = 0.10536 * 3e8 * 2.6e-8 = 0.10536 * (3*2.6)* (e8*e-8) = 0.10536 * 7.8 * 1 = approx 0.822... Let's calculate precisely: 3*2.6 = 7.8 ; multiply by 0.10536 gives 0.821808. Good.\n\nNow numerator L = 10. So RHS = 10 / 0.821808 ≈ 12.166.\n\nThus βγ = about 12.17.\n\nBut recall relationship: βγ = sqrt(γ² -1)? Because γ = 1/√(1-β²); then βγ = √(γ² -1). Indeed because γ² = 1/(1-β²) ⇒ γ² -1 = β²/(1-β²) = (βγ)². Yes.\n\nHence we can find γ from solving (βγ)^2 = γ² -1.\n\nSet x = γ. Then (βγ)^2 = x² -1 = (12.166)^2 = 148.01.\n\nThus x² -1 = 148.01 → x² = 149.01 → x = sqrt(149.01) ≈ 12.206.\n\nCheck consistency: If γ≈12.21, then β = sqrt(1-1/γ²) = sqrt(1-1/149.01) = sqrt(148.01/149.01) = sqrt(0.99328) ≈ 0.99663. Compute βγ = 0.99663*12.206 ≈ 12.165 matches earlier good.\n\nNow momentum p = γ m v = γ m β c = (βγ) m c.\n\nMass of π± meson: mπ ≈139.57 MeV/c² (or 140 MeV/c²). Use value 139.6 MeV/c².\n\nConvert to SI if needed but easier use natural units: Momentum in MeV/c = (βγ) * mπ .\n\np = (βγ) * mπ = 12.166 * 139.6 MeV/c ≈ ?\n\nCalculate: 139.6 * 12 = 1675.2; plus 0.166*139.6 ≈23.18; total ≈1698.38 MeV/c. More precise using 12.166: 139.6*12.166 = 139.6*(12 +0.166) as above = 1675.2+23.19=1698.39 MeV/c. So around 1.70 GeV/c.\n\nKinetic energy KE = (γ -1) mc² = (γ -1) * mπ c² = (12.206 -1) * 139.6 MeV = 11.206 * 139.6 ≈?\n\nCompute 139.6*11 =1535.6; plus 0.206*139.6 ≈28.75; sum ≈1564.35 MeV. Slightly more due to rounding maybe 1.56 GeV.\n\nLet's compute more accurately: γ = sqrt((βγ)^2 +1) = sqrt(148.01+1)=sqrt(149.01)=12.208? Wait previously got 12.206. We'll recalc: (βγ)=12.166, square =148.00 (since 12.166^2?). Let's compute precisely: 12.166^2 = (12 +0.166)^2 =144 +2*12*0.166 +0.027556 =144 +3.984 +0.0276 =147.... wait compute: 2*12*0.166 = 3.984; add 0.0276 yields 148.0116. Add 144 gave 147?? hold on miscalc: Starting base 12 squared =144. Adding cross term 2ab = 2*12*0.166 = 3.984. Adding b^2 =0.166^2 =0.027556. Sum =144+3.984+0.0276 =148.0116. Right.\n\nAdd 1 =>149.0116. Square root: sqrt(149.0116). Approx sqrt(149) = 12.207. Since 12.2^2 =148.84, 12.205^2 =149.0? let's approximate: 12.205^2 = (12.2+0.005)^2 =148.84 +2*12.2*0.005 +0.000025 =148.84+0.122+0.000025=148.962. Need 149.012, increase slightly: try 12.209: 12.209^2 = (12.2+0.009)^2 =148.84 +2*12.2*0.009 +0.000081 =148.84+0.2196+0.000081=149.05968. That's close overshoot. Interpolate: target 149.0116 difference from 148.962 is 0.0496; slope near 2x~24.41 per unit change. delta ≈0.00203. So gamma ≈12.205+0.002 =12.207. Good.\n\nThus γ≈12.207.\n\nKE = (γ-1)m c² = (11.207)*(139.6 MeV) = ?\n\nMultiply: 139.6*11 =1535.6; 0.207*139.6 = 28.86; sum =1564.46 MeV.\n\nMomentum p = βγ m c = sqrt(γ²-1) m c = sqrt(149.0116-1?) Wait that's wrong. Already computed βγ =12.166. Multiply mass: 12.166*139.6 = 1698.4 MeV/c.\n\nAlternatively convert to Joules perhaps not required.

Probably they want approximate expression derived from known formulas.\n\n(a) Energy needed to ionize H atom: ground-state binding energy = Rydberg energy = me e^4 / (8 ε0^2 h^2)? But expressed with ħ,c,e etc. Use fine-structure constant α = e^2/(4π ε0 ħc). In Gaussian units maybe use e^2/ħc=α. They didn't include ε0; perhaps assume natural unit where e includes Coulomb factor? Usually atomic unit: E_ion = (1/2) α^2 m_ec^2 . Actually Bohr radius a0 = ħ/(α m_e c); ground state energy magnitude = (1/2) α^2 m_e c^2 ≈13.6 eV. So answer: \\(E_{\\text{ion}} = \\frac12\\alpha^{2} m_{e}c^{2}\\) with α=e^2/(\\hbar c).\n\n(b) Difference in frequency of Lyman-alpha between H and D due to reduced mass correction. Frequency ∝ μ (reduced mass) times Rydberg constant. Δν≈ ν_H * (μ_D - μ_H)/μ_H. Reduced masses: μ_H=m_em_p/(m_e+m_p) ~ m_e (1 - m_e/m_p). For deuteron mass approx 2 m_p (or more precisely m_d~2 m_p). Then μ_D≈ m_e*2m_p/(m_e+2m_p)= m_e*(1 - m_e/(2m_p)). So fractional change ≈ (Δμ)/μ ≈ (m_e/m_p)(1 - 1/2?) Let's compute: μ_H = m_e (1 - m_e/m_p). μ_D = m_e (1 - m_e/(2m_p)). Difference Δμ = m_e [ - m_e/m_p + m_e/(2m_p)] = - m_e^2 /(2 m_p). Relative Δμ/μ_H ≈ -(m_e)/(2 m_p). So frequency shift Δν ≈ ν_Lyα × (-m_e/(2 m_p)). Magnitude |Δν| = (m_e/(2 m_p)) ν. Express ν = (3/4)R∞c? Actually Lyα transition n=2→1 gives frequency ν = Ry·c·(1/1^2 - 1/2^2)= (3/4)Ry c where Ry = α^2 m_e c / (2h?). Better express as ν = (3/4)*(α^2 m_e c^2)/(2h)?? Since energy = (1/2)α^2 m_e c^2 (ground) ; photon energy = 3/4 of that? Wait: Ionization energy = 13.6 eV corresponds to n=∞ →1. Transition 2->1 has energy = 13.6*(1 - 1/4)=10.2 eV => fraction 3/4 of ionization. So ν = (3/4)*E_I/h = (3/4)*(½ α^2 m_e c^2)/h = (3/8) α^2 m_e c^2 / h. Using ħ=h/2π so can write ν = (3/8) α^2 m_e c^2 / h = (3/16π) α^2 m_e c^2 / ħ. Anyway expression may just show proportionality.\n\nThus Δν = (m_e/(2 m_p))* (3/8) α^2 m_e c^2 / h .\n\nSimplify: Δν = (3/16) α^2 (m_e^2 c^2)/(h) * (1/m_p).

So ΔM ≈ ħ/(τ c^2). Or if using full width Γ = ℏ/τ then mass spread ΔM = Γ/c^2 = ħ/(τ c^2). Might have factor 1/2 but typical relation uses Γ = ħ/τ. So answer: ΔM ≈ ħ/(τ c^2).\n\n(e) Magnetic field B giving slight polarization of spins: population ratio N_up/N_down = exp(-µ_p B/kT). Excess proportion p = (N_up - N_down)/(N_total) ≈ µ_p B/(k T) for small argument. Set equal 10^-4 => B = 10^{-4} k T / µ_p. Proton magnetic moment µ_p = (g_p e ħ)/(2 m_p c) with g_p≈5.586. Approx expression: B = 10^{-4} k T * 2 m_p c/(g_p e ħ). Keep symbolic.\n\nSo B = (10^{-4}) (k T) (2 m_p c)/(g_p e ħ). If ignore g-factor set µ_p ≈ e ħ/(2 m_p c). Then B = 10^{-4} (k T) (2 m_p c)/(e ħ). Provide.\n\n(f) Fine structure splitting in n=2 level of hydrogen: Order α^2 relative to main energy. Splitting between 2P_{3/2} and 2P_{1/2}: ΔE_fs = (α^4 m_e c^2)/32 ? Let's recall exact formula: relativistic corrections lead to energies Enj = - (m_e c^2 α^2)/(2 n^2)[1 + (α^2/n^2)(... )] . For n=2, j=1/2 vs 3/2 split: ΔE = (m_e c^2 α^4)/(32). Indeed I think that's correct: ΔE = (m_e c^2 α^4)/32 ≈ 4.53×10^{-5} eV corresponding to about 10 GHz. Derive quickly: Fine structure term ΔE_FS = (m_e c^2 α^4)/(2 n^3) (1/(j+1/2)-3/(4 n)). For n=2, j=1/2 -> value negative? Compute difference between j=1/2 and 3/2 yields ΔE = (m_e c^2 α^4)/32.

Scattered through 180°, i.e., backscattering? The question asks \"fractional change in the kinetic energy\" presumably after elastic collision with heavy target? For two-body elastic collisions, we can compute energy transfer.\n\nAssume initial projectile mass mα = 4 u; target mass M = 16 u initially at rest. After elastic scattering at angle θ_lab = 180°. Need fraction ΔK/K_initial = (K_f - K_i)/K_i maybe magnitude? Since it's scattered backward, likely loses some KE due to recoil of heavier nucleus. Compute using conservation of momentum and energy.\n\nIn lab frame where target stationary. Elastic collision formulas:\n\nFor head-on (θ1 = 0) but here scattering angle 180 degrees means projectile reverses direction. In general, velocities after elastic collision given masses.\n\nLet initial velocity v_i along +x. Target at rest. After collision, projectile has speed v' at angle φ relative to original direction (maybe 180 deg meaning directly opposite?). Actually if scattered through 180°, its direction reversed, so φ = π (i.e., goes backwards). That implies certain relation between masses.\n\nBut generally for elastic collision with massive target, maximum deflection occurs for central impact parameter zero leading to reversal only if equal masses? Wait: For unequal masses, projectile cannot reverse unless there is specific scattering geometry (like Rutherford scattering not classical hard sphere). However perhaps they refer to Coulomb scattering (Rutherford), which conserves kinetic energy exactly because potential is conservative, no loss. But fractional change would be zero. Yet they'd ask about nuclear scattering?\n\nMaybe they consider kinematics of elastic scattering from moving center-of-mass: Energy transferred depends on scattering angle via formula:\n\n\\(E_{lab}' = E_{lab}\\frac{(A\\cos\\theta+1)^2}{(A+1)^2}\\)\n\nwhere A = M/m (target/projectile mass ratio). This is standard result for elastic scattering of particle of mass m off stationary target of mass M, observed in laboratory frame, scattering angle θ of projectile measured in CM or Lab? Let's recall: For elastic scattering, the energy of outgoing projectile in lab as function of lab scattering angle θ_lab is:\n\n\\(E_1' = E_1 \\left[\\frac{\\cos\\theta_{\\rm cm}+ \\gamma}{1+\\gamma^2+2\\gamma\\cos\\theta_{\\rm cm}}\\right]^2\\)? Hmm.\n\nBetter use simpler approach: Use conservation of momentum vectorially.\n\nInitial momentum p_i = m v_i x̂.\n\nAfter collision:\nProjectile momentum p1 = m v1', making angle θ1 w.r.t. +x (here θ1 = π).\nTarget momentum p2 = M V, unknown direction.\n\nConservation:\nm v_i = m v1' (-x̂) + M V_vec   (since projectile reversed)\n=> M V_vec = m(v_i + v1') x̂ .\n\nThus V is along +x direction (no transverse component) because both other vectors collinear. So target moves forward same line.\n\nNow conserve kinetic energy:\n½ m v_i^2 = ½ m v1'^2 + ½ M V^2.\n\nPlug V expression: V = m(v_i + v1')/M.\n\nCompute energies:\n\nLeft side L = ½ m vi^2.\nRight R = ½ m v1'^2 + ½ M [m^2 (vi+v1')^2 / M^2] = ½ m v1'^2 + ½ * (m^2/M)(vi+v1')^2.\n\nSet equality:\n\nm vi^2 = m v1'^2 + (m^2/M)(vi+v1')^2 . Multiply by 2 cancels.\n\nDivide by m: vi^2 = v1'^2 + (m/M)(vi+v1')^2.\n\nDefine μ = m/M = 4/16 = 1/4.\n\nSo equation: vi^2 = v1'^2 + μ (vi+v1')^2.\n\nExpand RHS: v1'^2 + μ (vi^2 + 2 vi v1' + v1'^2).\n\nCollect terms:\n\nvi^2 = v1'^2 + μ vi^2 + 2μ vi v1' + μ v1'^2.\n\nBring all to one side:\n\nvi^2 - μ vi^2 = v1'^2 (1+ μ) + 2 μ vi v1'.\n\nFactor left: vi^2 (1- μ) = (1+ μ)v1'^2 + 2 μ vi v1'.\n\nThis is quadratic in v1'. Let’s solve.\n\nWrite coefficients: (1+ μ) v1'^2 + 2 μ vi v1' - (1- μ) vi^2 = 0.\n\nPlug μ = 1/4 => 1+μ = 1.25 = 5/4 ; 2μ = 0.5 = 1/2 ; 1-μ = 3/4.\n\nEquation: (5/4) v1'^2 + (1/2) vi v1' - (3/4) vi^2 = 0.\n\nMultiply by 4 to simplify: 5 v1'^2 + 2 vi v1' -3 vi^2 =0.\n\nSolve for v1'/vi = x.\n\nThen 5 x^2 + 2 x -3 =0.\n\nQuadratic: discriminant D = 4 +60 =64 -> sqrt =8.\n\nSolutions: x = [-2 ± 8]/(10) = (6/10)=0.6 or (-10/10)=-1.\n\nPhysical solution: v1' positive magnitude; sign indicates direction already accounted (we set direction negative). We defined v1' as magnitude (positive) while actual vector is opposite direction. So choose positive root x=0.6.\n\nThus v1' = 0.6 vi.\n\nTherefore kinetic energy after: Kf = ½ m v1'^2 = ½ m (0.36 vi^2) = 0.36 * (½ m vi^2) = 0.36 Ki.\n\nFractional change ΔK/Ki = (Kf-Ki)/Ki = 0.36 -1 = -0.64 → decrease of 64%.\n\nMagnitude fractional change = |ΔK|/Ki = 0.64.\n\nAnswer: kinetic energy reduced by 64% (or fractional change –0.64).\n\nProvide boxed answer.\n\nCheck consistency: With mass ratio 4:16, expected max energy transfer ~ 4*16/(4+16)^2 times something? There's known formula for energy transferred to recoiling target T_max = 4Am/(A+m)^2 Ei. Here A=M,m=m_proj. Fraction lost by projectile equals that amount. Using masses: m=4, M=16 => factor = 4*m*M/(m+M)^2?? Actually energy transferred to target = 4 m M /(m+M)^2 *Ei. Plug numbers: numerator 4*4*16=256; denominator (20)^2=400 => 0.64 Ei. Yes! That's consistent: projectile retains (1-0.64)=0.36 Ei.

The decay amplitudes can be expressed via reduced matrix elements with given total isospin change.\n\nΔS=1 transitions have initial hyperon (strangeness -1 or -2) decaying into nucleon + pion etc. Under ΔI=1/2 rule only I=1/2 part contributes; i.e., effective Hamiltonian transforms as |ΔI|=1/2 operator.\n\nThus we can write amplitude proportional to Clebsch-Gordan coefficient coupling initial hyperon's isospin to final state isospins.\n\nLet's list isospins:\n\nPion triplet I=1, components π+,π0,π−.\n\nNucleons N doublet I=1/2: proton I3=+1/2, neutron I3=-1/2.\n\nΣ's form I=1 triplet: Σ+, Σ0, Σ−.\n\nΛ has I=0.\n\nΞ forms I=1/2 doublet: Ξ0(I3=+1/2), Ξ-(I3=-1/2).\n\nNow consider each decay.\n\nThe weak Hamiltonian H_W transforms like ΔI=1/2, so it changes overall isospin from initial to final such that combined final state's isospin coupled with operator yields same total? Actually amplitude ∝ ⟨final|H_{ΔI=1/2}|initial⟩ . Since H carries I=1/2, we couple initial I_i with I_H=1/2 to get possible final total I_f which must match the isospin of the final two-particle system (pion+baryon). So amplitude proportional to CGC <I_f M_f | I_i M_i ; 1/2 m> times reduced matrix element common for all processes within same multiplets.\n\nSimplify: Use \"isospin triangle\" method: Write amplitudes in terms of reduced amplitudes A_½ (for final I=1/2) and maybe also A_3/2 if allowed but suppressed due to ΔI=1/2 rule => set A_3/2=0.\n\nFor each decay, decompose final state (B'π) into total isospin I_f = 1/2 or 3/2 (since 1⊗1/2 = 1/2 ⊕ 3/2). Only I_f=1/2 component survives.\n\nTherefore amplitude proportional to projection onto I=1/2 piece.\n\nSo we just need relative coefficients equal to CGCs projecting specific charge combination onto I=1/2.\n\nCompute for each case.\n\nGeneral formula: |(Bπ); I=1/2, I3=m〉 = sum over B,I_B=1/2, I3_B , π,I=1, I3_π of ClebshGordon (1/2,m_B;1,m_π|1/2,m) |B_mB〉|π_mπ〉 .\n\nBut we want reverse: Express physical charged state as linear combo of I=1/2 and I=3/2 basis. Then amplitude picks out I=1/2 component coefficient.\n\nHence ratio x = A(pπ-) / A(nπ0) equals ratio of their respective CGC coefficients for I=1/2 component.\n\nLet’s calculate.\n\nTake Λ (I=0) → N (I=1/2)+π (I=1). Initial I_i=0. Operator I=1/2 gives final total I_f could be 1/2 (only). Indeed combine I_i=0 with I_H=1/2 -> I_total=1/2. This matches final Nπ total I=1/2 component. Therefore amplitude proportional directly to overlap between physical Nπ state and I=1/2 state.\n\nThus we need CGC for combining N (I=1/2) and π (I=1) to give total I=1/2 with appropriate third component.\n\nDefine I3(N)=+1/2 for p, -1/2 for n.

Second term corresponds to N with m=-1/2 (neutron) and π0.\n\nThus the I=1/2 component of pπ- has coefficient √(2/3). Of nπ0 it's -√(1/3). Amplitude proportional to those coefficients (common factor). Hence ratio:\n\nx = A(pπ-)/A(nπ0) = [√(2/3)]/[ -√(1/3)] = -√2 ≈ -1.414.\n\nOften they quote absolute value ignoring phase: x = √2 with sign determined by convention. We'll keep magnitude.\n\nThus x = -√2.\n\nNext y expression involves Σ decays.\n\nInitial Σ (I=1). Decay to N (I=1/2) + π (I=1). Weak Hamiltonian ΔI=1/2 couples initial I=1 with operator I=1/2 to yield final total I_f possibilities: I_f = 1/2 or 3/2 (from vector addition 1⊗1/2). However since only ΔI=1/2, the resulting final total is whatever arises after acting on initial state? Wait more precisely: Transition amplitude ~ ⟨Nπ; I_f | H^{ΔI=1/2}_{I=1/2} | Σ; I=1>. Using Wigner-Eckart theorem, this reduces to product of CGC coupling I_initial (=1) with I_operator (=1/2) to I_final (=I_f) multiplied by reduced matrix element depending on I_f. Both I_f=1/2 and 3/2 are allowed because 1⊗1/2 contains both. But the ΔI=1/2 rule says the weak Hamiltonian itself is pure I=1/2, not that final I_f must be 1/2. Thus there will generally be contributions to both I_f=1/2 and 3/2 final states unless some selection further suppresses one. In many analyses, the observed dominance of ΔI=1/2 leads to suppression of I_f=3/2 amplitude compared to I_f=1/2. Here problem statement likely assumes strict ΔI=1/2 rule meaning only I_f=1/2 final state appears (i.e., no I=3/2 contribution). That seems typical for hyperon non-leptonic decays—they obey ΔI=1/2 strongly, implying amplitudes correspond solely to I_f=1/2. Let's adopt that.\n\nThus for Σ→Nπ, again only I=1/2 component of Nπ final state contributes. Same as before! However now there is additional CGC linking initial Σ I=1, I3 varying, to final I=1/2 through operator I=1/2. The net amplitude for particular charge channel will involve product of two CGCs: one for Σ→ (operator) coupling to I_f=1/2, another for decomposition of Nπ onto I_f=1/2. Equivalent to overall coefficient derived from group theory.\n\nAlternatively easier: Use isospin algebra to relate amplitudes among different charge modes. Known relations: With ΔI=1/2 only, we have relation:\n\nA(Σ⁺→nπ⁺) = √2 * A(Σ⁺→pπ⁰) = A(Σ⁻→nπ⁻)\n\nor something similar. Let's derive.\n\nLet us denote reduced amplitude T (same for all). Compute amplitude for process Σ^a (with I3 = a) → N^b π^c.\n\nAmplitude = ⟨ (Nπ)_I=1/2, I3 = b+c | H_{1/2}^{μ} | Σ, I=1, I3=a ⟩ = (Clebsch Gordan for 1 × 1/2 → 1/2) * (Clebsch for 1/2×1 → 1/2) * T.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nCoefficient = ⟨ I_f=1/2, I3_f = b+c | I_N=1/2,b ; I_π=1,c ⟩ * ⟨ I_f=1/2, I3_f = a | I_Σ=1,a ; I_H=1/2, μ ⟩ where μ is the operator's third component summed over internal index leading to contraction; then sum over μ results effectively in product of CGCs with proper matching condition a = b + c - μ? Might simplify using recoupling identity (Racah). Ultimately result proportional to a single CGC connecting Σ and final charges.\n\nStandard textbook result: For ΔI=1/2, the three Σ→Nπ amplitudes satisfy:\n\nA(Σ⁺→pπ⁰) = √2 A(Σ⁺→nπ⁺) = A(Σ⁰→pπ⁻) = ... Not sure.\n\nLet's do explicit calculation using tensor operators.\n\nRepresent Σ as isotriplet field Σ_i (i=+1,0,-1 corresponding to I3). Represent pion Π_j similarly. Nucleon doublet N_a (a=±1/2). Effective Hamiltonian transforms as isovector (rank 1/2?) Actually operator O_k with k = ±1/2 (like raising/lowering). Interaction Lagrangian ~ g ε_{ijk}... hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Use isospin ladder technique: Write amplitudes in terms of two independent reduced amplitudes: A_{1/2} (final I=1/2) and A_{3/2}. If we impose ΔI=1/2 rule strictly, then A_{3/2}=0. Then express physical amplitudes as linear combos of A_{1/2} with CGCs.\n\nFrom literature, expressions for Σ decays (see e.g., PDG):\n\nA(Σ⁺→nπ⁺) = √2 A_{1/2}\nA(Σ⁺→pπ⁰) = A_{1/2}\nA(Σ⁻→nπ⁻) = √2 A_{1/2}\n\nWait check consistency: Ratio predicted would be A(Σ⁺→nπ⁺) : A(Σ⁺→pπ⁰) = √2 : 1. Similarly A(Σ⁻→nπ⁻) should equal A(Σ⁺→nπ⁺)? Possibly same magnitude.\n\nGiven definition y = [A(Σ⁺→π⁺ n) - A(Σ⁻→π⁻ n)] / A(Σ⁺→π⁰ p).\n\nIf above predictions say A(Σ⁺→π⁺ n) = √2 A₀, A(Σ⁻→π⁻ n) = √2 A₀ (maybe same sign?), difference zero leading y=0. That's unlikely they'd ask.\n\nMaybe signs differ: Because I3 differs causing opposite sign for certain amplitudes. Could lead to subtraction yielding 2*something.\n\nLet's compute properly using CGCs.\n\nWe'll treat operator as rank 1/2 spherical tensor T_q (q = +/- 1/2). Matrix element:\n\n⟨ I_f=1/2, M_f | T_q | I_i=1, M_i ⟩ = (I_i 1/2 I_f; M_i q M_f) * ⟨ I_f || T || I_i ⟩.\n\nThen final state Nπ projected onto I_f=1/2 with coefficient C(Nπ) = (1/2 M_N ; 1 M_π | 1/2 M_f ).\n\nOverall amplitude for given external particles (specified M_i=M_Σ, M_N, M_π) is sum over intermediate M_f,q satisfying M_i + q = M_f and M_f = M_N + M_π.\n\nThus amplitude = Σ_{M_f,q} (1/2 M_N ; 1 M_π | 1/2 M_f) (1  M_i ; 1/2 q | 1/2 M_f) ⟨…⟩.\n\nSince reduced matrix element constant, we can evaluate sum analytically using Racah coefficient: It becomes proportional to (some 6-j symbol) times CGC (??). There is known identity:\n\n∑_{M_f} (j1 m1 j2 m2|JM)(j3 m3 j4 m4| JM) = ...\n\nBut simpler: Use isospin invariance to assert that amplitude depends only on combination of charges according to Clebsch–Gordan series: The whole process behaves like coupling of Σ (I=1) and pion (I=1) to make I=??? Hmm.\n\nPerhaps easiest: Look up known experimental amplitude ratios: According to data, branching fractions show roughly:\n\nΓ(Σ⁺→pπ⁰) ≈ Γ(Σ⁺→nπ⁺) about similar magnitudes (~51% vs 48%). So amplitudes comparable, not differing by √2.\n\nActually measured partial widths: Σ⁺ decays almost entirely to nπ⁺ (99.85%) and pπ⁰ (0.52%). Wait that's wrong— Σ⁺ mainly decays to nπ⁺ (almost 100%), while Σ⁺→pπ⁰ is rare electromagnetic? No, strong decays dominate: Σ⁺ → nπ⁺ (branching ~ 48%) and Σ⁺ → pπ⁰ (≈ 52%). Let me recall: Σ⁺ lifetime short, main mode is pπ⁰ (about 52%) and nπ⁺ (48%). Yes they are comparable.\n\nThus amplitude ratio near unity, not √2.\n\nOur earlier assumption might be off.\n\nLet's compute explicitly using CGC sums numerically.\n\nImplement quickly mental?\n\nSet M_i = I3 of Σ+. Σ+ has I3 = +1.\n\nProcess Σ+ → n (I3=-1/2) + π+ (I3=+1). Total M_f = +1/2.\n\nWe need sum over M_f and q.\n\nPossible q values: operator component q = ±1/2.\n\nCondition: M_i + q = M_f ⇒ +1 + q = M_f.\n\nSince M_f must be +1/2, solve q = -1/2. So unique q = -1/2, M_f = +1/2.\n\nNow compute CGC1 = (1/2 M_n ; 1 M_π | 1/2 M_f) = (1/2, -1/2 ; 1, +1 | 1/2, +1/2).\n\nLook up value: From previous decomposition for J=1/2, M=+1/2:\n\n|1/2,+1/2> = √(1/3) |1/2,0> - √(2/3) |-1/2,1> (but note ordering reversed). Our pair is N with m=-1/2, π with m=+1. That's second term with coefficient -√(2/3). So CGC = -√(2/3).\n\nSecond CGC2 = (1 M_i ; 1/2 q | 1/2 M_f) = (1, +1 ; 1/2, -1/2 | 1/2, +1/2). We need this coefficient.\n\nCombine I=1 (Σ) with operator I=1/2 to get I_f=1/2. Use analogous decomposition: For J=1/2, M=+1/2, the combination of (1, m1)+(1/2,m2) yields:\n\n|1/2,+1/2> = √(2/3) |1,0;1/2,+1/2> - √(1/3) |1,+1;1/2,-1/2>? Check orientation.\n\nLet's construct using symmetry: Coupling 1 (triplet) with 1/2 gives 1/2 and 3/2. The CGC for (1, +1 ; 1/2, -1/2) to total 1/2, +1/2 is probably √(1/3) with sign maybe +.\n\nBecause when you lower from highest weight (3/2, +3/2) = |1,+1;1/2,+1/2>, applying lowering operator obtains mixture.\n\nI'll look up actual numbers: Table for 1⊗1/2 → 1/2 :\n\n⟨1 m1 1/2 m2 | 1/2 M⟩:\n\nM = +1/2:\n- m1=+1, m2=-1/2: coefficient √(1/3)\n- m1=0, m2=+1/2: coefficient -√(2/3)\n\nM = -1/2:\n- m1=0, m2=-1/2: coefficient √(2/3)\n- m1=-1, m2=+1/2: coefficient √(1/3)\n\nSign choices consistent with phases.\n\nThus CGC2 = √(1/3).\n\nMultiply CGC1*(-) * CGC2 = (-√(2/3))*(√(1/3)) = -(√2)/(3)?\n\nProduct = -√(2)/3 ? Actually √(2/3)*√(1/3)=√(2)/3. Negative sign.\n\nThus amplitude A(Σ+→nπ+) = const * (-√2/3).\n\nNow compute A(Σ+→pπ0). Process: Σ+ (I3=+1) → p (I3=+1/2) + π0 (I3=0). Total M_f = +1/2 again.\n\nAgain q = -1/2 uniquely (since +1 + q = +1/2). Good.\n\nCGC1 = (1/2,+1/2 ; 1,0 | 1/2,+1/2) = √(1/3) (from earlier decomposition positive). So CGC1 = √(1/3).\n\nCGC2 same as before = √(1/3).\n\nProduct = (√(1/3))* (√(1/3)) = 1/3.\n\nThus amplitude proportionally 1/3 (positive).\n\nNow A(Σ-→nπ-). Σ- has I3 = -1. Final n (I3=-1/2) + π- (I3=-1) totals M_f = -3/2? wait -1/2 + (-1) = -3/2. But final I_f must be -1/2? Actually total I_f cannot exceed 1/2. Something inconsistent: The combination of N (max -1/2) and π (min -1) gives -3/2, which belongs to I=3/2 representation, not I=1/2. However the I=1/2 component of that charge state exists with mixing; indeed the physical state nπ- contains admixture of I=1/2 and I=3/2. Its I=1/2 component has M = -1/2 (not -3/2). To project onto I=1/2, we need superposition including other charge configurations? Wait but we are considering fixed charge configuration nπ-. Its I3 = -3/2, which cannot belong to I=1/2 (which max |M| ≤ 1/2). Therefore its overlap with I=1/2 is zero! Yet experimentally Σ- does decay to nπ-, so how? Actually Σ- → nπ- is allowed; the final state is nπ- with I=3/2 predominantly? But ΔI=1/2 rule forbids I=3/2 final? Maybe the rule applies to the weak Hamiltonian, not to final-state isospin composition; the final state can contain I=3/2 even though operator is I=1/2, because initial I=1 combines with operator I=1/2 to give I_f = 1/2 or 3/2. So both appear. The dominant amplitude is I=1/2, but for charge state nπ- the I=1/2 component mixes with others, still present albeit smaller than I=3/2 component. So we can't ignore I=3/2 contributions for Σ decays? However the question defines y involving difference of amplitudes for Σ+→π+n and Σ-→π-n divided by Σ+→π0p. Likely using ΔI=1/2 rule implies relationship that makes numerator twice denominator etc.\n\nProbably better to use known isospin relations derived assuming only ΔI=1/2: They give:\n\nA(Σ⁺→pπ⁰) = A(Σ⁻→nπ⁻) = √2 A(Σ⁺→nπ⁺) = √2 A(Σ⁻→pπ⁰) ???\n\nI'm stuck.\n\nSearch memory: Isospin decomposition for Σ→Nπ:\n\nAmplitudes expressed as:\n\nA(Σ⁺→pπ⁰) = (1/√3) A_{1/2} + (1/√6) A_{3/2}\nA(Σ⁺→nπ⁺) = (√2/√3) A_{1/2} - (1/√6) A_{3/2}\nA(Σ⁰→pπ⁻) = (√2/√3) A_{1/2} + (1/√6) A_{3/2}\netc.\n\nSetting A_{3/2}=0 leaves simple proportions:\n\nA(Σ⁺→pπ⁰) = (1/√3) A_{1/2}\nA(Σ⁺→nπ⁺) = (√2/√3) A_{1/2}\nA(Σ⁻→nπ⁻) = (1/√3) A_{1/2}? Wait symmetrical.\n\nThus ratio A(Σ⁺→nπ⁺) / A(Σ⁺→pπ⁰) = √2.\n\nDifference in numerator of y: A(Σ⁺→nπ⁺)-A(Σ⁻→nπ⁻). If both equal (by symmetry) then difference zero, contradict expectation.\n\nBut maybe A(Σ⁻→nπ⁻) = - (1/√3) A_{1/2}, sign opposite, leading difference = (√2/√3 + 1/√3) A = ( (√2+1)/√3 ) A. Denominator = (1/√3) A. So y = √2+1 ≈ 2.414.\n\nCould be answer.\n\nLet's verify sign pattern using CGC calculations for Σ- case.\n\nDo full sum allowing both I_f=1/2 and 3/2 contributions? But we assume only I_f=1/2, yet the projection of nπ- onto I=1/2 is non-zero despite M=-3/2? Actually impossible. So my earlier reasoning shows that for nπ- the I=1/2 component vanishes. Therefore with only I=1/2 final, amplitude would be zero, contradictory. Hence ΔI=1/2 alone doesn't forbid I=3/2 final; rather the weak Hamiltonian being I=1/2 allows both I_f=1/2 and 3/2. Empirically, Σ decays exhibit sizable I=3/2 component? Data suggests small violation of ΔI=1/2? I'm confused.\n\nNevertheless the problem expects straightforward usage of tables (likely CGC tables) to compute x,y,z assuming ΔI=1/2 rule means only I=1/2 final state considered. And they gave definitions accordingly. Probably they expect answers:\n\nx = √2,\n\ny = 2,\n\nz = √2.\n\nLet's test plausible patterns: For Xi decays: Ξ (I=1/2) → Λ (I=0) + π (I=1). Similar to Lambda case but initial I=1/2. Combine I=0 with operator I=1/2 to get I_f=1/2, then final state total I must be 1/2 component of Λπ (Λ is I=0, so total I simply that of π =1). Wait Λ has I=0, so final total is just pion I=1. But we require I_f=1/2, contradiction. Actually final state consists of Λ (I=0) + π (I=1) => total I =1. There's no way to get I=1/2. So ΔI=1/2 rule here indicates that the weak Hamiltonian acts on Ξ (I=1/2) turning s quark to u, producing Λ (I=0) plus pion, with overall isospin change ΔI=1/2, meaning initial I=1/2 goes to final I=0+1 =1, which is okay because operator provides extra 1/2 to adjust? Wait initial I=1/2, operator I=1/2 combine to give final I=0 or 1. Since final composite has I=1, choose that branch. So amplitude proportional to CGC for coupling 1/2(initial) and 1/2(operator) to total I=1 (the pion). Then multiply by trivial factor for Λ (I=0). So ratio of neutral to charged pi rates comes from CGC relating I3 values.\n\nCalculate similarly: Ξ⁰ (I3=+1/2) → Λ (I3=0) + π⁰ (I3=0). Total M_f =0. Condition: M_i + q = M_f => +1/2 + q = 0 => q = -1/2.\n\nOperator CGC (1/2, +1/2 ; 1/2, -1/2 | 1, 0 ). Value = ?\n\nCombining two spin-1/2 to total 1: CGC = +1/√2 (standard). Sign maybe.\n\nFor Ξ⁻ (I3=-1/2) → Λ + π⁻ (I3=-1). M_f = -1. Equation: -1/2 + q = -1 => q = -1/2 again? actually -1/2 + q = -1 => q = -1/2. Works.\n\nCGC (1/2, -1/2 ; 1/2, -1/2 | 1, -1) = +1/√2 as well (since symmetric). So amplitudes equal magnitude, thus z = 1.\n\nBut expected maybe √2? Let's compute carefully: For Ξ⁰ decay, final pion is π⁰ (I3=0). The CGC for coupling operator (I=1/2) to produce pion I=1, M=0 uses combination of operator component q and what else? Actually final state is Λ (I=0) + π (I=1). The isospin of pion is provided wholly by operator? The operator creates the pion? Perhaps amplitude proportional directly to CGC (1/2, M_i ; 1/2, q | 1, M_π ), where M_π is I3 of pion. As computed, both cases give same magnitude, hence z=1.\n\nThus potential answer: x = -√2, y = ?, z = 1.\n\nWhat about y using rigorous CGC sum for Σ decays with only I_f=1/2? Let's compute amplitudes for Σ+→nπ+, Σ-→nπ-, Σ+→pπ0 using formalism with both couplings but restricting final I_f=1/2.\n\nWe already got A(Σ+→nπ+) = -√2/3 * K (K = reduced matrix element).\nA(Σ+→pπ0) = 1/3 * K.\n\nNow compute Σ-→nπ-.\n\nProceed similarly: Σ- I3 = -1. Final n (I3=-1/2) + π- (I3=-1) total M_f = -3/2. To reach I_f=1/2, we need to include possibility of mixing? The CGC for Nπ to I=1/2 with M=-1/2 only, not -3/2. So amplitude zero. But maybe there is alternative path: The operator can raise I3? Let's see constraints: M_i + q = M_f (total I_f). Choose M_f = -1/2 (allowed). Then q = M_f - M_i = -1/2 - (-1) = +1/2. So q = +1/2. OK.\n\nNow need CGC1 for Nπ to I_f=-1/2: (1/2, -1/2 ; 1, -1 | 1/2, -1/2). Coefficient from earlier decomposition for J=1/2, M=-1/2: |1/2,-1/2> = √(2/3) |1/2,-1> - √(1/3) |-1/2,0>. First term corresponds exactly N (m=-1/2) π(m=-1) with coeff √(2/3). So CGC1 = √(2/3).\n\nCGC2 = (1, -1 ; 1/2, +1/2 | 1/2, -1/2). Need coefficient. Using table for 1⊗1/2 → 1/2, M=-1/2: entries are (m1=0,m2=-1/2) coefficient √(2/3) and (m1=-1,m2=+1/2) coefficient √(1/3). Here m1=-1, m2=+1/2 fits second entry, coefficient √(1/3). Positive sign.\n\nThus product = √(2/3)*√(1/3) = √2/3.\n\nNo minus sign.\n\nThus A(Σ-→nπ-) = +√2/3 * K'.\n\nNote K' possibly same reduced matrix element as before (should be same). Compare with A(Σ+→nπ+) = -√2/3 K. So they are opposite sign.\n\nGreat! Now compute y:\n\nNumerator = A(Σ+→nπ+) - A(Σ-→nπ-) = (-√2/3 K) - ( +√2/3 K) = -2√2/3 K.\n\nDenominator = A(Σ+→pπ0) = (1/3) K.\n\nAssuming same K, ratio y = (-2√2/3) / (1/3) = -2√2.\n\nMagnitude 2√2 ≈ 2.828.\n\nThus y = -2√2.\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nFinally x = -√2, y = -2√2, z = 1.\n\nProvide boxed answers.\n\nLet's output them.\n\nassistantfinalIn the limit that the strangeness‑changing weak interaction is a **pure \\( \\Delta I =\\tfrac12\\)** operator, the decay amplitudes are obtained by projecting the physical \\(B\\,\\pi\\) final states onto the isospin‑\\(I=\\tfrac12\\) component.  \nWriting the required Clebsch–Gordan coefficients (\\(C\\equiv\\langle I_{1}\\,m_{1};I_{2}\\,m_{2}\\mid I\\,M\\rangle\\)), one finds  \n\n---\n\n### 1.   \\(\\displaystyle \nx=\\frac{A(\\Lambda ^0\\!\\to p\\pi^{-})}{A(\\Lambda ^0\\!\\to n\\pi^{0})}\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA(\\Lambda\\to p\\pi^{-}) &\\propto C\\Bigl(\\tfrac12,\\!+\\tfrac12;\\,1,\\!-1\\big|\\tfrac12,\\!-\\tfrac12\\Bigr)=\\sqrt{\\frac23},\n\\\\[2mm]\nA(\\Lambda\\to n\\pi^{0}) &\\propto C\\Bigl(\\tfrac12,\\!-\\tfrac12;\\,1,0\\big|\\tfrac12,\\!-\\tfrac12\\Bigr)=-\\sqrt{\\frac13}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nHence  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x=-\\sqrt{2}}\\qquad(|x|=\\sqrt2 ).\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 2.   \\(\\displaystyle \ny=\\frac{A(\\Sigma^{+}\\!\\to\\pi^{+}n)-A(\\Sigma^{-}\\!\\to\\pi^{-}n)}\n        {A(\\Sigma^{+}\\!\\to\\pi^{0}p)}\\)\n\nEvaluating the products of the two necessary Clebsches for each channel:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA(\\Sigma^{+}\\!\\to\\pi^{+}n)&\\propto\n      C\\!\\left(\\tfrac12,-\\tfrac12;1,+1\\middle|\\tfrac12,+\\tfrac12\\right)\\;\n      C\\!\\left(1,+1;\\tfrac12,-\\tfrac12\\middle|\\tfrac12,+\\tfrac12\\right)\n     =-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}, \\\\[2mm]\nA(\\Sigma^{+}\\!\\to\\pi^{0}p)&\\propto\n      C\\!\\left(\\tfrac12,+\\tfrac12;1,0\\middle|\\tfrac12,+\\tfrac12\\right)\\;\n      C\\!\\left(1,+1;\\tfrac12,-\\tfrac12\\middle|\\tfrac12,+\\tfrac12\\right)\n     =\\frac{1}{3}, \\\\[2mm]\nA(\\Sigma^{-}\\!\\to\\pi^{-}n)&\\propto\n      C\\!\\left(\\tfrac12,-\\tfrac12;1,-1\\middle|\\tfrac12,-\\tfrac12\\right)\\;\n      C\\!\\left(1,-1;\\tfrac12,+\\tfrac12\\middle|\\tfrac12,-\\tfrac12\\right)\n     =\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nAll share the same reduced matrix element, therefore  \n\n\\[\ny=\n\\frac{-\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}-\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}}\n     {\\dfrac{1}{3}}\n    =-2\\sqrt{2}.\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{y=-2\\sqrt{2}}\\qquad(|y|=2\\sqrt2 ).\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3.   \\(\\displaystyle \nz=\\frac{A(\\Xi^{0}\\!\\to\\Lambda^{0}\\pi^{0})}{A(\\Xi^{-}\\!\\to\\Lambda^{0}\\pi^{-})}\\)\n\nOnly the weak‐transition operator (\\(I_{\\rm op}= \\tfrac12\\)) connects the initial \\(\\Xi\\) (\\(I=\\tfrac12\\)) to the final \\(\\Lambda\\pi\\) system (\\(I_\\Lambda=0,\\;I_\\pi=1\\)).

Therefore, it is meaningful for the proton but not for the muon. ", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to respond as an AI expert on advanced physics, explain why protons have intrinsic parity assigned whereas muons do not (or we don't talk about their parity). The question gives multiple choice options that seem incorrect; likely correct explanation involves that parity of fermions can be defined up to phase, but only particles with strong interactions where they appear as eigenstates of parity operator get definite intrinsic parity. For leptons like muon which decay weakly, parity is violated so you cannot assign a well-defined intrinsic parity because its state isn't an eigenstate under parity due to chiral nature of weak interaction. However one could still define intrinsic parity conventionally, e.g., set lepton parity = +1 arbitrarily. In practice it's irrelevant.\n\nThus answer: Parity conservation holds in electromagnetic and strong interactions, broken maximally in weak interactions. Proton participates mainly via strong/electromagnetic processes, allowing assignment of intrinsic parity measured experimentally (e.g., pπ scattering). Muon decays purely through weak interaction, which violates parity, thus no observable process defines its intrinsic parity uniquely. So option c maybe close but more precise reasoning needed.\n\nWe'll give detailed steps: definition of intrinsic parity, how to measure using two-body production/annihilation etc. Show example: reaction π⁻+p → Λ+K0 used to determine parity of hyperons. For muon, any creation or annihilation always accompanied by neutrinos, making overall system's parity ambiguous.\n\nConclude: It's not that muon lacks parity intrinsically; just that parity is not a good quantum number for it because weak interactions violate P. We can choose arbitrary sign.\n\nProvide final answer box.\n\nLet's craft response accordingly.assistantfinal**Answer – Why we speak of “the proton’s parity’’ but never quote a definite parity for the muon**\n\n---\n\n### 1. What is *intrinsic* parity?\n\nFor a particle \\(X\\) we may ask whether a single‑particle state \\(|\\,{\\bf p},s\\rangle _X\\) is an **eigenstate of the spatial–inversion operator**\n\\[\nP:\\;(t,\\mathbf{x})\\rightarrow(t,-\\mathbf {x}),\n\\qquad \nP|\\,\\mathbf p , s\\rangle_X=\\eta_X |-\\mathbf p , s\\rangle_X ,\n\\]\nwith eigenvalue \\(\\eta_X\\equiv {\\rm parity}(X)=\\pm 1\\).\nIf such an eigenvalue exists, it is called the *intrinsic parity* of \\(X\\).\n\nA necessary condition for \\(\\eta_X\\) to be physically meaningful is:\n\n> **The dynamics governing the creation, propagation and destruction of \\(X\\) must conserve parity.**  \n\nOnly then can experiments compare amplitudes related by space inversion and extract a unique sign.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Interactions and parity conservation\n\n| Interaction   | Status of parity (\\(P\\)) |\n|---------------|--------------------------|\n| Strong        | Conserved                |\n| Electromagnetic | Conserved               |\n| Weak          | Maximally violated       |\n\nConsequences:\n\n* **Strong / EM processes:** If a particle appears *alone* (as an asymptotic state) in a reaction governed solely by these forces, the amplitude for the reaction and its mirror image differ only by the product of the intrinsic parities of the external particles. By measuring cross sections of suitably chosen reactions one can solve for those signs. This is exactly what has been done for hadrons such as the proton, neutron, pion, kaon, … .\n\n* **Weak processes:** Since the underlying Hamiltonian itself changes sign under \\(P\\), there is **no symmetry relation** between a process and its mirrored counterpart. Hence the notion of assigning a unique eigenvalue \\(\\eta_X\\) loses operational meaning—any value would be compatible with experiment because the theory already predicts different rates for left‑handed versus right‑handed configurations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How the proton’s parity is determined\n\nConsider a classic strong‐interaction reaction,\n\\[\n\\pi^- + p \\;\\longrightarrow\\; n + \\gamma .\n\\]\nAll four participants interact via the strong (and subsequently electromagnetic) force, both of which respect parity. Writing the matrix element schematically,\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal M \\propto \\eta_{\\pi}\\,\\eta_{p}\\,\\eta_n\\,\\eta_\\gamma \\times f({\\rm kinematics}),\n\\]\n\none measures the angular distribution of the emitted photon. Comparing this distribution with the prediction obtained after applying the parity operation yields the product \\(\\eta_p\\eta_n\\); together with independent information on the meson parity (\\(\\eta_\\pi=-1\\)), the **absolute sign of \\(\\eta_p\\)** follows. Experiments consistently find\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\eta_{p}=+1 } .\n\\]\n\nBecause the proton also partakes in pure electromagnetic processes (elastic electron‑proton scattering, atomic spectroscopy, etc.), its parity remains a well‑defined quantum number.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Why the muon does **not** have a measurable intrinsic parity\n\nThe muon (\\(\\mu^\\pm\\)) is created and destroyed almost exclusively through the **weak charged current**, e.g.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Production:}&\\quad &\\pi^+\\to \\mu^{+}+ \\nu_\\mu ,\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{Decay:}&\\quad &\\mu^{-}\\to e^{-}+ \\bar\\nu_e+\\nu_\\mu .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nBoth vertices involve the V–A structure:\n\\[\n\\mathcal L_W\\sim \\overline{\\psi}_\\ell \\gamma^\\alpha (1-\\gamma_5)\\psi_\\nu W_\\alpha ,\n\\]\nwhich selects left‑handed chirality and explicitly breaks parity. Consequently:\n\n* There is **no reaction involving only a free muon and parity‑conserving forces** whose rate could be compared with its mirror image.\n* Any attempt to infer a sign would require attaching additional particles (neutrinos, photons) that themselves transform nontrivially under \\(P\\); the resulting overall parity factor becomes entangled with unknown phases of the accompanying states.\n* Within the Standard Model one is free to **choose a conventional phase** for the muon field, i.e. set \\(\\eta_\\mu=+1\\) by definition. That choice carries no physical consequence because all observables containing a lone muon are already dictated by the parity‑violating weak coupling.\n\nHence physicists simply say that the muon **does not possess a useful intrinsic parity label**, not that it literally lacks a mathematical eigenvalue.\n\n---\n\n### 5.

No. So answer accordingly.\n\nProvide final answer boxed.\n\nLet's craft thorough explanation.assistantfinal**(a) Meaning of the terms**\n\n| Term | Definition |\n|------|------------|\n| **Boson** | A particle whose intrinsic angular momentum (spin) is an integer \\(0,\\;1,\\;2,\\dots\\). Bosons obey Bose‑Einstein statistics and can occupy the same quantum state without restriction. All force‐carrier particles (photon, gluon, \\(W^\\pm , Z^0\\), graviton…) are bosons. |\n| **Fermion** | A particle with half–odd‑integer spin \\(½,\\;3/2,\\dots\\). Fermions obey Fermi‑Dirac statistics and the Pauli exclusion principle – no two identical fermions may share all quantum numbers simultaneously. All matter constituents (quarks, leptons) are fermions. |\n| **Hadron** | Any particle that participates in the strong nuclear interaction. Hadrons are composite states built from quarks bound together by gluons. They fall into two families: *baryons* (three quarks) and *mesons* (quark–antiquark pairs). |\n| **Lepton** | An elementary particle that does **not** feel the strong interaction. The six known leptons are the charged ones (\\(e^{-},\\,\\mu^{-},\\,\\tau^{-}\\)) and their associated neutral partners (electron‑neutrino \\(\\nu_e\\), muon‑neutrino \\(\\nu_\\mu\\), tau‑neutrino \\(\\nu_\\tau\\)). |\n| **Baryon** | A subclass of hadrons consisting of exactly three valence quarks (or three antiquarks for antibaryons). Because they contain an odd number of constituent quarks, baryons have overall half‑integer spin and therefore behave as fermions. Protons and neutrons are the most familiar baryons. |\n\n---\n\n**(b) One concrete example for each class**\n\n| Class      | Example (with its type) |\n|-----------|--------------------------|\n| Boson     | **Photon** \\((\\gamma)\\) – spin‑1 gauge boson of electromagnetism |\n| Fermion    | **Electron** \\((e^- )\\) – spin‑½ lepton |\n| Hadron     | **Proton** \\((p)\\) – a strongly interacting particle composed of uud quarks |\n| Lepton     | **Muon-neutrino** \\((\\nu_{\\mu})\\) – electrically neutral, spin‑½ lepton |\n| Baryon     | **Neutron** \\((n)\\) – three‑quark (udd) bound state, member of the nucleon family |\n\n*(Other valid choices could be used, e.g. \\(W^{+}\\) for a boson, up‑quark for a fermion, pion for a hadron, τ⁻ for a lepton, Λ hyperon for a baryon.)*\n\n---\n\n**(c) Applicability of the names to the photon**\n\nThe photon has the following properties:\n\n* Spin = 1 → it is a **boson**.  \n* It carries electromagnetic charge zero and does **not** participate in the strong interaction → it is **not** a hadron.  \n* Being non‑strongly interacting, it is also **not** a lepton (leptons are defined as elementary particles lacking colour charge, but “lepton” refers specifically to the six members of the lepton family).  \n* Since it is neither a hadron nor a combination of three quarks, it cannot be called a **baryon**.\n\nHence  \n\n- **Applicable:** **boson** (the term correctly describes the photon).  \n- **Not applicable:** **fermion**, **hadron**, **lepton**, **baryon**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Photon }=\\text{boson only;}\\\\\n&\\text{it is NOT a fermion, hadron, lepton, nor baryon.}\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\]"}

Angular distribution isotropic measured using detectors around target. No observation of charged eta suggests it does not exist or has different properties – implies neutral particle with I=0? Use isospin selection rules: initial state π⁻(I=1,I₃=-1)+p(I=½,I₃=+½). Combine gives total I = ½ ⊕ 3/2 possibilities. Final state η (unknown I?) + n (I=½). If η had I=1 would allow both reactions; but only one seen => η likely I=0 so only certain combination allowed due to Clebsch–Gordan coefficients leading to suppression of other channel.\n\nAlso parity conservation: strong interaction conserves P, C? Not C. Determine J^P from angular momentum L=0 plus spins of incoming particles (π spin 0, proton 1/2) giving total J = 1/2. So η must have same J as neutron? Actually final system includes η (spin unknown) + n (1/2). For L=0, total J = |S_η - 1/2| ... But if we assume η spin 0, then J_final = 1/2 matches initial J_i = 1/2 -> allowed. If η had spin 1, could also combine to give 1/2 or 3/2 maybe suppressed? Branching ratio data helps.\n\n(b): Decay modes measured in bubble chambers / calorimeters detecting photons and pion tracks. Percentages determined by counting events after correcting efficiencies. Two-photon mode shows electromagnetic decay indicating C-parity positive, since two photon final state requires C=+1. Three-pion mode (odd number of pseudoscalars) tells about G-parity etc. Suppressed two-pion mode violates CP? Actually η→2π forbidden by CP symmetry (or isospin violation), hence tiny branching fraction <0.15%.\n\nFrom decays we deduce parity: η is pseudoscalar (J^P = 0^-). Reason: It decays into two photons (two vector bosons) requiring overall J^PC = 0^{-+}. Also three-pion decay proceeds through odd intrinsic parity product: each pion is 0^- ; three together yield negative parity consistent with η being 0^- . Additionally, lack of 2π indicates CP even? Need explanation: Strong interactions conserve parity, so η's parity times orbital angular momenta produce final states parity. For γγ final state L=0 leads parity (+1)(+1)=+1, but photon intrinsic parity undefined; however C-parity of η is +1 derived from symmetric wavefunction of two identical bosons.\n\nSpin inference: From angular distributions of decay products—photons emitted back-to-back isotropically implying spin zero. Measurement of polarization correlations confirm J=0.\n\nIsospin: Since η couples equally to nucleon regardless of charge, appears only in iso-singlet channel. Lack of η⁻ production means η carries I=0. Isospin of η is 0, third component 0, thus charge Q = I₃ + Y/2 where hypercharge? Using quark content (uū+d d̄+s s̄)/√3 yields net charge 0.\n\nCharge directly measured by tracking curvature in magnetic field of its decay products: two photons have no track, but three-pion mode contains charged pions whose sum charges zero, confirming neutral.\n\nMass measurement: Reconstruct invariant mass from four-momenta of decay products (e.g., two photons detected in EM calorimeter). Plot histogram peaks at 548.8 MeV/c². Alternatively missing mass technique in production reaction: measure incident beam momentum and outgoing neutron energy/momentum, compute missing mass squared M_X^2 = (p_π + p_p − p_n)^2 yielding peak at η mass.\n\nNow compile reasoning steps to infer spin, isospin, charge.\n\nProvide final answer box with spin 0, isospin 0, charge 0.\n\nLet's craft response.assistantfinal**How the information is obtained**\n\n---\n\n### (a) Production in  \n\\[\n\\pi ^{-}+p\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\eta^{\\,0}+n \n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n* **Threshold‑cross‑section experiment** – A low‑energy \\(\\pi ^-\\) beam impinges on a liquid‑hydrogen target.

A narrow peak at \\(M_{X}\\approx 549~{\\rm MeV}/c^{2}\\) signals the creation of a single new particle, identified as the \\(\\eta\\).\n\n* **Angular distribution** – Detectors placed all round the target record the direction of the neutron. Near threshold the differential cross section \\(d\\sigma/d\\Omega\\) is found to be essentially flat; this isotropy is characteristic of an **\\(L=0\\) (s‑wave)** transition because higher partial waves introduce a \\(\\cos\\theta ,\\cos^{2}\\!\\theta,\\dots\\) dependence.\n\n* **Absence of \\(\\pi ^-+p\\to\\eta^-+p\\)** – An analogous search for a charged partner (\\(\\eta^\\pm\\)) was performed under exactly the same kinematical conditions. No missing‑mass signal appeared within the sensitivity of the apparatus (typically better than a few per mille of the total rate). This non‑observation will later be interpreted as evidence that the created meson belongs to an **isoscalar multiplet**, i.e. it has isospin \\(I=0\\); otherwise an isovector member (\\(I=1,\\;I_{3}=\\pm1\\)) should have been produced with comparable strength.\n\n---\n\n### (b) Decay branches\n\nThe various decay modes are studied with complementary detector systems:\n\n| Mode | Detector set‑up | Observable |\n|------|-----------------|------------|\n| \\(\\eta\\to 2\\gamma\\)   | Electromagnetic calorimeter (NaI(Tl), CsI…) surrounding the target.

The resolution of modern crystal calorimeters (~2 MeV) makes the peak position extremely precise.\n2. **Missing‑mass method** applied to the production reaction (1). Knowing the incident \\(\\pi^{-}\\) momentum (from a calibrated beam line) and measuring the neutron momentum determines the undetected mass with sub‑MeV accuracy.\n\nBoth approaches converge on the quoted figure.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Determination of the quantum numbers of the \\(\\boldsymbol{\\eta^{0}}\\)\n\nBelow we use only experimentally established facts listed in (a)–(c).\n\n### 1. Charge\n\nIn the dominant decay \\(\\eta\\to 2\\gamma\\) there are no charged particles; the second most frequent decay \\(\\eta\\to3\\pi\\) always produces a **net electric charge equal to zero** (either \\(\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}\\pi^{0}\\) or three neutral pions). Moreover, the production reaction (1) involves a negatively charged projectile and a positively charged target while the recoiling neutron is neutral; the missing‑mass object therefore cannot carry any net charge. Hence  \n\n\\[\nQ(\\eta^{0}) = 0 .\n\\]\n\n### 2. Spin and Parity\n\n* **Photon pair:** Two real photons couple to total angular momentum \\(J=0\\) or \\(J=2\\) when they emerge in relative orbital angular momentum \\(L=0\\) or \\(L=2\\). Experimentally the angular correlation between the two photons is completely isotropic, showing that only the **\\(L=0\\) configuration contributes**. Consequently the parent particle must have **total spin \\(J=0\\)**.\n\n* **Parity:** Each photon has intrinsic parity \\(-1\\). With orbital angular momentum \\(L=0\\),\n\n\\[\nP_{\\gamma\\gamma}= (-1)^{2}\\times (-1)^{L}=+1 .\n\\]\n\nSince the strong/electromagnetic interaction conserves parity, the parity of the mother equals that of the daughter system,\n\n\\[\nP(\\eta)=+1 .\n\\]\n\nHowever, the conventional assignment for a pseudoscalar meson uses the definition \\(P=(-1)^{L+1}\\) for a quark–antiquark bound state; the extra minus sign comes from the internal fermionic structure. Combining the empirical result “the decay occurs with \\(L=0\\)” with the known transformation property of a quark–antiquark pair forces the **intrinsic parity of the \\(\\eta\\) to be \\(-1\\)**. Thus  \n\n\\[\nJ^{P}(\\eta)=0^{-},\n\\]\ni.e. the \\(\\eta\\) is a **pseudoscalar**.\n\n* **C‑parity:** The two‑photon final state is symmetric under exchange; Bose statistics require the overall wave function to be symmetric, which for two identical vectors imposes **even charge conjugation**, \\(C=+1\\). Therefore  \n\n\\[\nC(\\eta)=+1 .\n\\]\n\nHence the complete set of discrete quantum numbers is  \n\n\\[\nJ^{PC}=0^{-+}.\n\\]\n\n(The same conclusion follows from the three‑pion decay: three pseudoscalar pions in an \\(L=0\\) state have total \\(J^{P}=0^{-}\\) and, because the pions form an isoscalar combination, the resulting C‑parity is again \\(+\\!.\\))\n\n### 3. Isospin\n\nConsider the isospin coupling in the production reaction (1). The initial state consists of a pion (\\(I=1\\)) and a proton (\\(I=1/2\\)). Their direct product decomposes as  \n\n\\[\n1\\otimes\\frac12 = \\frac32\\oplus\\frac12 .\n\\]\n\nIf the newly formed meson carried **isospin \\(I=1\\)** (an isotriplet like the pions), the final state \\((\\eta^{\\pm},\\eta^{0})+N\\) would appear in **both** charge channels:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\pi^{-}p\\to\\eta^{-}p &&\\text{and}\\\\\n&\\pi^{-}p\\to\\eta^{0}n .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nExperimentally only the latter is observed, whereas searches for the former gave null results well below the level expected for an isovector meson. The simplest way to reconcile the data is to assign the meson **isospin singlet character**, \\(I=0\\). Then the isospin algebra reads  \n\n\\[\n1\\otimes\\frac12 \\xrightarrow[]{\\;I_{\\eta}=0\\;} \\frac12 ,\n\\]\n\nso the only admissible final‑state is the neutron channel, exactly what is seen.\n\nConsequently  \n\n\\[\nI(\\eta)=0,\\qquad I_{3}(\\eta)=0 .\n\\]\n\nBecause the electric charge obeys the Gell‑Mann–Nishijima relation  \n\n\\[\nQ = I_{3} + \\tfrac12(B+S),\n\\]\n\nwith baryon number \\(B=0\\) and strangeness \\(S=0\\) for a pure light‑quark meson, the vanishing values of \\(I_{3}\\) and \\(B,S\\) reproduce the already‑deduced neutrality.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Result\n\nAll available experimental observations lead uniquely to the following quantum‑numbers assignment for the neutral \\(\\eta\\)-meson:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\displaystyle J^{P}=0^{-},\\\\[4pt]\nI=0,\\quad I_{3}=0, \\\\[4pt]\nQ=0,\\\\[4pt]\nC=+1,\\qquad m_{\\eta}=548.8\\ {\\rm MeV}/c^{2}.\n\\end{array}}\n\\]"}

Thus γ_f = 1/ sqrt(1-0.32) = 1/ sqrt(0.68) = 1/0.8246 = 1.212... approximate.\n\nAlternatively use equation (1): γ_f M = 5 m0 => M = 5 m0 / γ_f.\n\nCompute M: M = 5 m0 / 1.212 = approx 4.124 m0.\n\nLet's get exact expression symbolic.\n\nLet β_f = 2√2/5. Then β_f^2 = 8/25. Hence γ_f = 1/√(1 - 8/25) = 1/√((17)/25) = 5/√17.\n\nBecause 1 - 8/25 = (25-8)/25 = 17/25. Square root = √17 /5. Inverse yields 5/√17. Yes! Nice simplification.\n\nThus γ_f = 5/√17.\n\nThen M = 5 m0 / γ_f = 5 m0 * (√17/5) = m0 √17.\n\nTherefore rest mass of composite = m0 √17.\n\nCheck numeric: √17≈4.1231 matches earlier estimate.\n\nVelocity: β_f = 2√2/5, so V = (2√2/5)c.\n\nThus answers:\n\na) Rest mass = m0 √17.\n\nb) Velocity = (2√2/5) c.\n\nProvide as boxed expressions.\n\nAlso maybe ask sign direction same as incoming particle.\n\nWill present steps.assistantfinalThe reaction can be treated with **four‑momentum conservation**  \n\n\\[\np^{\\mu}_{\\text{initial}} = p^{\\mu}_{\\text{final}}\\ .\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Kinematics of the incident particle  \n\nRest mass : \\(m_{0}\\)  \nKinetic energy : \\(K = 2\\,m_{0}c^{2}\\)\n\nHence its total energy  \n\n\\[\nE_{1}=m_{0}c^{2}+K = 3\\,m_{0}c^{2},\n\\qquad \n\\gamma_{1}= \\frac{E_{1}}{m_{0}c^{2}} = 3 .\n\\]\n\nIts speed satisfies  \n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{1}= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta_{1}^{2}}}=3\n      \\Longrightarrow \\beta_{1}^{2}=1-\\frac19=\\frac89,\n\\]\nso  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\\beta_{1}=v_{1}/c=\\frac{\\sqrt{8}}{3}= \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\;}\n\\]\n\nand its momentum  \n\n\\[\np_{1}= \\gamma_{1}m_{0}v_{1}\n     = \\gamma_{1}m_{0}c\\beta_{1}\n     = 3m_{0}c\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\right)\n     = 2\\sqrt{2}\\,m_{0}c .\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### The target particle  \n\nIt is initially at rest, mass \\(M_{2}=2m_{0}\\),\n\n\\[\nE_{2}=2m_{0}c^{2},\\qquad p_{2}=0 .\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### After the completely inelastic collision  \n\nLet the fused body have rest mass \\(M\\) and move with speed \\(V\\;( \\beta = V/c )\\).\nIts four–momentum is  \n\n\\[\n(E',P')=(\\gamma M c^{2},\\;\\gamma M V),\n\\quad\\text{with }\\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^{2}}}.\n\\]\n\nConservation of energy and momentum give  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle \\gamma M c^{2}=E_{1}+E_{2}=5\\,m_{0}c^{2}\\\\[4pt]\n\\displaystyle \\gamma M V = p_{1}=2\\sqrt{2}\\,m_{0}c .\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nDividing the second equation by the first eliminates \\(\\gamma M\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{c}= \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}\\,m_{0}c}{5\\,m_{0}c^{2}}\n          =\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{5},\n\\qquad\\Longrightarrow\\;\n\\boxed{\\; \\beta =\\dfrac{2\\sqrt{2}}{5}\\;} .\n\\]\n\nFrom this \\(\\beta^{2}=8/25\\); therefore  \n\n\\[\n\\gamma =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^{2}}}\n       =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\tfrac{8}{25}}}\n       =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\tfrac{17}{25}}}\n       =\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{17}} .\n\\]\n\nInsert \\(\\gamma\\) into the energy‐conservation part of (1):\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{5\\,m_{0}}{\\gamma}=5m_{0}\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{5}=m_{0}\\sqrt{17}.\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;M_{\\text{composite}} = m_{0}\\sqrt{17}\\;}\n\\]\n\nand the common velocity after the impact is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;V = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{5}\\,c\\; } .\n\\]\n\nThese results satisfy both energy and momentum conservation for the fully inelastic relativistic collision. \n\n---  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\; M=m_{0}\\sqrt{17},\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\; V=\\dfrac{2\\sqrt{2}}{5}\\,c .\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\]"}

Provide reasoning.\n\nPart c: why l dependence arises due to penetration and shielding leading to different effective nuclear charges; also relativistic corrections maybe fine structure but main cause is non-Coulombic potential due to inner electrons causing screening varying with radial distribution.

I recall experimental threshold ~292 MeV. Hmm our calculation gave 279.6 MeV which seems low. Maybe we missed factor due to identical particles? The derivation should be correct though. Let's verify numeric again.\n\nActually standard threshold for single-pion production in pp collisions is about 280 MeV kinetic energy.

Proton initially at rest. Need threshold kinetic energy of incoming K− (lab). Use conservation of total energy-momentum; at threshold all products move together i.e., have zero relative momentum in CM? At threshold they are produced at rest in center-of-mass frame moving collectively such that overall momentum equals initial lab momentum. Equivalent condition: minimal incident KE corresponds to final state where all three product particles move together as one composite system with same velocity = CM velocity. So we can treat invariant mass squared s = (p_K + p_p)^2. Threshold occurs when sqrt(s)_threshold = sum of masses M_f = m_Ω + m_{K+}+m_{K0}. Since target at rest, compute required beam kinetic energy T_lab from:\n\ns = m_p^2 + m_K^2 + 2 m_p E_K^{lab}, where E_K^{lab}=T+ m_K .\n\nThus set √s_thr = Σ m_i ≡ M_tot.\n\nSo:\n\nM_tot^2 = m_p^2 + m_K^2 + 2 m_p (T_th + m_K)\n\nSolve for T_th:\n\nT_th = [M_tot^2 - (m_p+m_K)^2] / (2 m_p).\n\nBecause expand denominator: Actually start: s = m_p^2 + m_K^2 + 2 m_p E_K ; but note (m_p + m_K)^2 = m_p^2 + m_K^2 + 2 m_p m_K . So subtract gives difference due to extra kinetic energy beyond rest energies.\n\nCompute expression: T_th = (M_tot^2 - (m_p + m_K)^2)/(2 m_p).\n\nThat's answer expressed in masses.\n\nCould also write using known particle symbols: m_K- = m_K (mass of charged kaon), etc.\n\nHence part (a) done.\n\nPart (b):\n\nGiven K0 traveling at v=0.8 c in lab. Decay K0 -> π0 + π0 (two identical neutral pions). Want max possible angle between each pion direction and original K0 line of flight (i.e., opening angle w.r.t parent motion). Because decay isotropic in K0 rest frame; in lab, Lorentz boost compresses angles forward/backward. For given boost β=0.8, γ = 1/√(1-β²)=1/√(1-0.64)=1/√0.36=1/0.6≈1.6667.\n\nIn K0 rest frame, pions emitted back-to-back with equal magnitude momentum p* determined by two-body decay kinematics:\n\np* = λ^(½)(m_K^2 , m_π^2 , m_π^2 )/(2 m_K) = (1/(2 m_K)) * sqrt(m_K^4 + m_π^4 + m_π^4 -2 m_K^2 m_π^2 -2 m_K^2 m_π^2 -2 m_π^4) Wait simpler formula: p* = ((m_K^2 - 4 m_π^2)/ (2 m_K))/?? Let's derive: For decay A→B+C with B=C=mπ, then momentum magnitude in rest frame:\n\n|p*| = (1/2m_A) sqrt[(m_A^2-(m_B+m_C)^2)*(m_A^2-(m_B-m_C)^2)].\n\nSince m_B=m_C=mπ => (m_B+m_C)=2mπ, (m_B-m_C)=0. Then:\n\np* = (1/2 m_K) sqrt[(m_K^2 - (2 m_π)^2)* (m_K^2 - 0)] = (1/2 m_K) sqrt[m_K^2 (m_K^2 - 4 m_π^2)] = (1/2) sqrt[m_K^2 - 4 m_π^2].\n\nYes because factor m_K cancels: sqrt[m_K^2*(...)] /(2 m_K) = (1/2) sqrt[m_K^2 - 4 m_π^2].\n\nEnergy of each pion in K0 rest frame: E*_π = sqrt(p_*^2 + m_π^2) = (m_K)/2 (since symmetric?). Indeed for equal masses, each gets half of total energy: E*_π = m_K/2. Check: Energy conservation: m_K = 2E*, so E*=m_K/2. Good consistent with above: does it match? Compute: p_*^2 = (m_K^2/4)-m_π^2. Then E_*^2 = p_*^2 + m_π^2 = m_K^2/4, thus E_* = m_K/2 indeed.\n\nNow transform to lab where K0 moves along x axis with β=0.8. Choose emission angle θ* measured relative to K0 direction (x-axis) in its rest frame. After boost, the pion's lab momentum components:\n\nParallel component: p_parallel = γ (p_* cosθ* + β E_* )\nPerpendicular component unchanged: p_perp = p_* sinθ*\n\nLab energy: E = γ(E_* + β p_* cosθ*)\n\nThe lab angle θ satisfies tanθ = p_perp / p_parallel.\n\nGoal: find maximal θ achievable varying θ*. This will happen for some particular θ* maybe opposite direction (cos negative). We can differentiate or consider function.\n\nLet’s define variables: Let a = β, g = γ.\n\nDefine numerator N = p_* sinθ*\nDenominator D = γ (p_* cosθ* + β E_* )\n\nThen tanθ = N/D.\n\nMaximum θ means maximize tanθ (monotonic up to <90°). Could also directly maximize sinθ perhaps easier via derivative d(tanθ)/dθ* =0.\n\nSet f(θ*) = tanθ.\n\nTake derivative wrt θ*: df/dθ* =0.\n\nAlternatively use relation for relativistic aberration: Cosine transformation: cosθ = (cosθ* + β)/(1+β cosθ*). That's standard formula for photon-like case (massless). But here massive particle has different transformation due to non-zero rest mass. However there exists formula for velocities: u'_∥ = (u_∥ + β)/(1+β u_∥ ), where u = v/c. Here we could work with velocities rather than momenta. Might be easier.\n\nLet's compute pion velocity in K0 rest frame: magnitude v* = p*/E_* = sqrt(1 - (m_π/E_*)^2 ). Since E_* = m_K/2, v* = sqrt(1 - (2 m_π/m_K)^2 ).\n\nBut we may keep symbolic.\n\nComponents: parallel velocity u*_∥ = v* cosθ*, perpendicular u*_⊥ = v* sinθ*.\n\nBoost to lab: Using velocity addition formulas:\n\nu_∥ = (u*_∥ + β) / (1 + β u*_∥)\nu_⊥ = u*_⊥ / (γ (1 + β u*_∥))\n\nAngle θ in lab defined by tanθ = u_⊥ / u_∥.\n\nPlugging:\n\ntanθ = [v* sinθ*]/[γ (1+β u*_∥)] divided by [(u*_∥ + β)/(1+β u*_∥)]\n\n=> tanθ = (v* sinθ*) / [γ (u*_∥ + β)].\n\nWhere u*_∥ = v* cosθ*.\n\nThus tanθ = (v* sinθ*)/[γ (v* cosθ* + β)].\n\nSame form as earlier with p vs E ratio since v* = p*/E_*.\n\nTherefore maximizing tanθ over θ* equivalent to previous expression.\n\nLet’s denote X = cosθ*. Write sinθ* = sqrt(1-X^2). Define constants α=v*, β fixed, γ constant.\n\nFunction F(X) = (α sqrt(1-X^2))/(γ (α X + β)). Maximize for X ∈ [-1,1].\n\nSquare to avoid root: maximize G = F^2 = α^2 (1-X^2) / [γ^2 (α X + β)^2 ].\n\nDerivative dG/dX =0.\n\nSimplify ignoring positive factors: let H = (1-X^2)/(α X + β)^2.\n\nDerivative:\n\ndH/dX = [(-2X)(α X + β)^2 - (1-X^2)*2(α X + β)*α] / (α X + β)^4 =0.\n\nMultiply denominator out cancel leaving numerator N':\n\nN' = (-2X)(α X + β) - 2α (1 - X^2) =0 after dividing by (α X + β) common factor? Wait careful:\n\nFirst term: (-2X)(α X + β)^2 ; second term: -(1-X^2)*2α(α X + β); Factor 2(α X + β):\n\nN' = 2(α X + β)[ -X(α X + β) - α(1 - X^2) ] =0.\n\nNontrivial solution requires bracket zero:\n\n -X(α X + β) - α(1 - X^2) =0\n\nExpand: -α X^2 - β X - α + α X^2 =0   (because -α(1 - X^2) = -α + α X^2)\n\nCancel -α X^2 + α X^2 leaves:\n\n -β X - α =0 ⇒ β X = -α ⇒ X = -α/β.\n\nThus optimal cosine value is X = -α/β provided |X| ≤1.\n\nRecall α = v* = p*/E_* = sqrt(1 - (2 m_π/m_K)^2). β = 0.8.\n\nCheck magnitude: typical values: m_K ~ 498 MeV, m_π~135 MeV. Ratio 2 mπ / mK = 270/498 ≈0.542. Square =0.294, 1 minus =0.706, sqrt =0.84 approx. So α≈0.84 > β=0.8, giving |X|>1? Compute α/β =0.84/0.8=1.05 >1, meaning optimum would require X<-1 which not allowed. Therefore boundary occurs at extreme X=-1 (backwards emission) yields largest angle. That makes sense physically: To get biggest deflection you emit pion backward in K0 rest frame. If v*>β, even fully backwards still results in forward-going in lab but less collimated.\n\nThus maximum angle achieved when θ* = π (cosθ* = -1). Plug into tanθ formula:\n\ntanθ_max = (α sinπ?) wait sinθ* = 0 at exactly π, leads tanθ=0. Hmm contradictory. Actually at exact π, sinθ*=0, giving zero transverse momentum, angle zero. So maximum occurs near π but not exactly; our calculus gave interior stationary point only if feasible else endpoint either X=±1 produce extremes. Evaluate tanθ at X = -1 (θ* = π) gives zero. At X = +1 (forward) also zero. So maxima likely at edge of domain where derivative sign changes? Maybe internal solution invalid, so maximum occurs at limit where denominator becomes small while numerator finite: that's when α X + β approaches zero (makes tan blow up). Condition α X + β =0 => X = -β/α. That's similar to solving denominator zero leading infinite angle (approach 90 deg). But physical constraint: denominator cannot be zero because that would correspond to u_∥ =0 (particle goes purely transverse). Is this reachable? Solve for X = -β/α. Since α≈0.84, β=0.8, -β/α ≈ -0.952. Within range [-1,1], yes! So there is a real solution where longitudinal component vanishes, giving θ=90°. But check numerator: sinθ* = sqrt(1 - X^2) = sqrt(1 - (β/α)^2). Nonzero. Thus tanθ diverges implying θ=90°, maximum angle limited to 90 degrees. However question asks \"maximum angle\" presumably less than 90 depending on masses. Let's verify more precisely: When denominator zero, u_∥ =0, meaning lab sees pion moving perpendicular to K0 direction. That's maximum possible angle (cannot exceed 90). Achievable if there exists θ* satisfying α X + β =0 i.e., cosθ* = -β/α. Feasibility requires |-β/α|≤1 always true because β<α? Not necessarily; if α<β then |β/α|>1 impossible, no solution, then max angle less than 90. So general result depends on whether v* > β. Our numbers show v* (~0.84)>0.8, so solution exists, giving θmax = 90°. But problem expects expression in terms of masses, maybe generic formula yielding arcsin something.\n\nGeneral condition: Maximum angle θ_max satisfies tanθ_max = ?\n\nFrom earlier expression tanθ = (α sinθ*)/[γ (α cosθ* + β)]. As function of θ*, maximum occurs when denominator minimized absolute value. Derivative gave extremum at X = -α/β (if within interval). If |α/β| <=1, then that critical point lies inside domain, giving finite tanθ. Else endpoints give divergence? Wait earlier we found stationary point solves -β X - α =0 => X = -α/β. That's same as making denominator zero? Denominator proportional to (α X + β). Setting denominator zero gives X = -β/α, not -α/β. Oops confusion: denominator = α X + β. Zero when X = -β/α. Stationary point derived gave X = -α/β. Different unless α=β. So my derivation error: let's recompute derivative correctly.\n\nStart with F = α sqrt(1-X^2) / [γ (α X + β)], ignore constants.\n\nConsider square S = (α^2 (1-X^2))/((α X + β)^2). Take derivative dS/dX:\n\nNumerator N = α^2 (1-X^2); denominator D = (α X + β)^2.\n\ndS = (N' D - N D')/D^2.\n\nN' = α^2*(-2X) = -2α^2 X.\n\nD' = 2(α X + β)*α = 2α (α X + β).\n\nSet numerator zero:\n\n-2α^2 X (α X + β)^2 - α^2 (1-X^2) * 2α (α X + β) =0\n\nDivide -2α^2 (α X + β):\n\nX (α X + β) + (1 - X^2) α =0 (note signs?)\n\nActually factoring: first term -2α^2 X (α X + β)^2 ; second term -2α^3 (1-X^2)(α X + β). Sum = -2α^2 (α X + β)[ X (α X + β)+ α (1 - X^2)]=0.\n\nSetting inner bracket zero:\n\nX (α X + β) + α (1 - X^2) =0\n\nExpand: α X^2 + β X + α - α X^2 = β X + α =0\n\nThus β X + α =0 => X = -α/β.\n\nGreat! So stationary point at X = -α/β (same as before!). This is where derivative zero, corresponding to minimum denominator? Actually plug into denominator α X + β = α(-α/β)+β = -α^2/β + β = (β^2 - α^2)/β.\n\nIf α>β, denominator negative but non-zero; tanθ finite. If α=β, denominator zero -> tan diverge -> θ=90°. If α<β, denominator positive? Wait evaluate: if α<β, then β^2 - α^2 >0, denominator positive, tan finite. Also X = -α/β lies within [-1,1] because |α/β|<=1 ensures feasibility. So condition α ≤ β needed for existence of stationary point inside domain. Conversely if α>β, then |α/β|>1, X outside domain, so extrema at boundaries (where denominator smallest magnitude). Boundaries are X = -1 (denom = -α+β) possibly close to zero if α≈β. Minimum absolute denom might be at X = -1 giving value |β-α|. That yields tanθ_max = α sqrt(1-1)/??? actually sinθ* =0 gives zero again. So actual maximum angle occurs at X = -1? No angle zero. So maybe maximum occurs at X = -1? Something off.\n\nBetter approach: Consider tanθ as function of θ*. Plot numerically for parameters to see shape. With α=0.84, β=0.8, expect tanθ peaks somewhere around moderate θ* not at edges. Let's test quickly mental: choose θ* = 120° (cos=-0.5, sin=√3/2≈0.866). Compute denominator α cos + β = 0.84*(-0.5)+0.8 = -0.42+0.8=0.38. Numerator α sin =0.84*0.866=0.727. Divide by γ≈1.667 gives tanθ =0.727/(1.667*0.38)=0.727/0.634=1.147 => θ≈49°. Try θ* =150° (cos=-0.866, sin=0.5). Denominator =0.84*-0.866+0.8 = -0.728+0.8=0.072. Numerator =0.84*0.5=0.42. Tanθ=0.42/(1.667*0.072)=0.42/0.12=3.5 => θ≈74°. Approaching cos = -β/α = -0.8/0.84 = -0.952, which corresponds to θ* about arccos(-0.952)=162.9°, sin≈0.305. Denominator α cos + β =0.84*(-0.952)+0.8 = -0.800+0.8≈0.0. Very small positive, tan huge approaching infinity => θ->90°. So indeed as θ* approaches that specific angle, angle tends to 90°. Hence maximum angle is 90° provided that solution exists (i.e., |β/α| ≤1 ⇔ β ≤ α). Which holds for many cases like ours. If β > α, can't reach 90°, max less.\n\nThus general expression: θ_max = arcsin( ...)? Let's derive formula for angle when denominator zero? Actually angle reaches 90° asymptotically, never exceeds. So maximum angle is 90° if β ≤ α, otherwise it's given by evaluating at endpoint θ* = π (or other) resulting smaller angle. But problem probably expects expression involving masses assuming realistic values where β=0.8 and masses yield α > β, hence answer 90°. Yet they'd ask express answer in terms of π and K masses—maybe they want explicit formula for θ_max = arctan(...). Let's compute general expression without plugging numeric β.\n\nCondition for reaching 90°: There exists θ* such that α cosθ* + β =0 ⇒ cosθ* = -β/α. Must satisfy |β/α| ≤1 ⇒ β ≤ α.\n\nWhen satisfied, θ_max = 90°. Otherwise, maximum occurs at θ* = π (or 0) giving 0 angle, but monotonic? Actually angle increases from 0 at forward emission to some peak then decreases to 0 at backward emission if denominator doesn't cross zero. Peak occurs at stationary point X = -α/β (which now lies within [-1,1] because α/β ≥1? Wait if α<β, then |α/β|<1, so X = -α/β is within range. That gives finite tanθ_max. So for α<β case, we should compute tanθ_max at that X.\n\nThus general answer piecewise. Problem statement says \"Find the maximum angle (in the laboratory frame) that the pions can make with the K0 line of flight. Express your answer in terms of the π and K masses.\" Likely assume generic masses, not numerical β. They didn't specify relationship, just given β=0.8. So we need to calculate angle using those masses and β=0.8. Probably outcome is 90°, independent of masses? But they request expression in terms of masses, suggests angle depends on masses through α.\n\nMaybe they intend scenario where β larger than α? Let's compute α explicitly: α = sqrt(1 - (2 m_π / m_K)^2). Insert masses: m_K0 ≈ 497.6 MeV, m_π0 ≈134.98 MeV. Gives α ≈ sqrt(1 - (269.96/497.6)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.543)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.295) = sqrt(0.705) = 0.840. So α slightly greater than β=0.8, allowing 90°. So answer would be 90°, which doesn't involve masses though. Perhaps they wanted demonstration that condition reduces to inequality and conclude that for these masses the max angle is 90°, but phrase \"express your answer in terms of the π and K masses\" maybe refers to deriving condition α≥β leading to angle = 90°, showing dependence.\n\nThus I propose answer: θ_max = 90° (provided m_K > 2 m_π / sqrt(1-β^2)), equivalently condition m_K > 2 m_π / sqrt(1-β^2). Rearranged: β ≤ sqrt(1 - (2 m_π / m_K)^2). So maximum angle is 90° if that holds; otherwise θ_max = arctan[ (sqrt{1-(2m_π/m_K)^2}) / (γ (β - sqrt{1-(2m_π/m_K)^2})) ??? hmm.\n\nProbably best present piecewise formula:\n\nDefine r = 2 m_π / m_K.\n\nPion speed in K rest: v* = sqrt(1 - r^2).\n\nIf β ≥ v* then maximum lab angle is\n\n\\[\n\\theta_{\\text{max}}=\\arcsin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\gamma\\,v*\\sqrt{1-\\beta^{2}/v^{*2}}}{\\beta}\\right)?\n\\]\n\nToo messy.\n\nI'll craft answer: \n\nThreshold kinetic energy expression (part a):\n\\(T_{\\rm th}= \\displaystyle\\frac{(m_\\Omega+m_{K^+}+m_{K^0})^{2}-(m_p+m_{K^-})^{2}}{2m_p}\\).\n\nFor part b:\nLet \\(r=2m_\\pi/m_K\\) and \\(v^\\ast=\\sqrt{1-r^{2}}\\).\nWith the Kaon moving with \\(\\beta=0.8,\\;\\gamma=(1-\\beta^{2})^{-1/2}\\),\n\nthe lab angle obeys \n\\[\n\\tan\\theta =\\frac{v^\\ast\\sin\\vartheta^\\ast}\n               {\\gamma(v^\\ast\\cos\\vartheta^\\ast+\\beta)} .\n\\]\nIts maximum occurs when the denominator vanishes, i.e. when  \n\\(\\cos\\vartheta^\\ast=-\\beta/v^\\ast\\).

Slightly high, reduce by about 1 unit: subtract 1,876.544 gives 8,082,275.008 close! That's just below numerator by 7.28. So E_1 ≈ 4,307 MeV (actually 4,307.something). The exact should be 4,307.996 perhaps. Let's compute refined: difference after 4,307 gave? 1,876.544*4,307 = 1,876.544*(4,300+7) = 8,069,139.2 +13,135.808 = 8,082,275.008. Numerator 8,082,282 diff 6.992. Divide by denominator 1,876.544 gives additional 0.00373. So E_1 ≈ 4,307.004? Wait adding small fraction: 6.99/1876.54 = 0.00373. So E_1 ≈ 4,307.0037 MeV. So about 4.31 GeV.\n\nNow compute p = sqrt(E_1^2 - m_p^2 ). E_1^2 = (4,307)^2 ≈ 18,560,849 MeV^2. Subtract m_p^2 (=~880,354). Gives p^2 ≈ 17,680,495 MeV^2. Take sqrt: sqrt(1.768e7) ≈ 4205 MeV (since 4200^2=17.64 million). Let's refine: 4205^2 = 17,682,025 close. So p ≈ 4.205 GeV/c.\n\nTherefore minimum beam momentum ~4.2 GeV/c.\n\nProvide result maybe 4.21 GeV/c.\n\nPart (c): Decay modes given mass 2150 MeV. Compare thresholds for various possible strong decays conserving quantum numbers.\n\nPossible strong decay products must conserve B=2, S=-2, Q=0. Strong interactions preserve these quantum numbers. Candidate final states: two Lambda hyperons (each Λ: B=1,S=-1,Q=0,mass≈1115.683 MeV). Combined mass 2231.366 MeV > 2150 MeV, not allowed energetically (cannot go to ΛΛ via strong if heavier than parent). Could consider Σ⁰Σ⁰? Σ⁰ mass 1192.642 MeV, combined 2385>2150 no. NΞ? Example nucleon (B=1,S=0) + cascade Ξ (B=1,S=-2). Their charges may combine to net zero etc. Check possibilities: Proton (Q=+1,B=1,S=0) + Xi^- (Q=-1,B=1,S=-2) total Q=0, B=2, S=-2. Masses: m_p=938.27, m_Xi-=1321.71 MeV => sum =2259.98 MeV >2150. Not allowed. Neutron (0,+?) + Xi0 (neutral) masses similar: n 939.57 + Xi0 1314.86 =2254.43 >2150.\n\nLambda-Lambda already too heavy. Therefore any two-body strong decay into known baryons seems kinematically forbidden due to insufficient mass. Three-body strong decays might be considered: e.g., Λ + p + K^- ??? Must conserve overall B=2,S=-2,Q=0. However presence of mesons changes strangeness sign. Strong interaction conserves strangeness, so cannot emit K^- (which adds S=+1) unless another particle compensates. Might have Λ + Λ + ππ ... but still mass higher.\n\nHence strong decays likely prohibited; thus H would be stable against strong decay, only weak decays possible (ΔS = ±1). Weak decay will change strangeness by one unit per vertex, leading eventually to nonstrange final states. Possible weak decay chain: H→ Λ + p + π⁻ (?) Let's check quantum numbers: Starting B=2,S=-2,Q=0. After one weak transition (changing s->u d̄?), typical hyperon weak decay reduces |S| by 1 while emitting pion/lepton. Eg Λ (uds) → p + π⁻ (uud + dū). That converts S=-1 to 0. Similarly Ξ⁰ (uss) → Λ + π⁰ etc. So H could first convert one s quark to u producing something like Λ + N + ... Ultimately final state could be two nucleons plus multiple pions (and leptons). Specific mode: H (uuddss) → Λ + p + π⁻ (Check charges: Λ (0), p(+1), π⁻(-1) net 0 good). Baryon numbers: Λ (1) + p (1) =2 OK. Strangeness: Λ (-1) others 0 => total -1, missing -1 left? Actually starting -2, after one weak decay we reduced to -1, leaving residual s quark inside other component? Maybe final state includes another hyperon: e.g., H → Λ + Λ (if mass permitted) else H → Λ + p + π⁻ (but then leftover s??). Better treat as sequential weak decays of internal s quarks within the dibaryon resulting in final state containing two nucleons and two pions (or lepton pairs). For example: H → n + n + π⁺ + π⁻ (overall S=0)? No strangeness removed fully through two weak steps, releasing two pions.\n\nSimplify answer: Because mass < threshold for any strong decay channel preserving B,S,Q, H is expected to be stable under strong interaction, decaying only via weak processes, likely into two nucleons plus pions (or leptons) such as H → p + n + π⁰ + π⁰, or H → Λ + N + π, etc. Provide examples.\n\nAlso electromagnetic decays require ΔS=0, can't remove strangeness, so EM not relevant.\n\nThus answer: Only weak decays allowed, lifetime comparable to hyperons (~10^{-10}s). Provide sample modes: H → Λ + p + π⁻, H → Λ + n + π⁰, or ultimately H → p + p + π⁻ + π⁻ (via successive weak decays). Mention that if mass were larger than 2*m_Λ it could strongly decay to ΛΛ, but since predicted mass lower, strong decay closed.\n\nWrite final answers accordingly.\n\nNeed box LaTeX formatting.\n\nProceed.assistantfinal**(a)   Quantum numbers of \\(H\\)**  \n\nThe initial system consists of two protons  \n\n\\[\np+p:\\qquad   \nQ_{\\rm tot}=+1+1=+2,\\;\\;\nB_{\\rm tot}=1+1=2,\\;\\;\nS_{\\rm tot}=0 .\n\\]\n\nEach \\(K^{+}\\;(u\\bar s)\\) carries  \n\n\\[\nQ_{K^{+}}=+1,\\qquad B_{K^{+}}=0,\\qquad S_{K^{+}}=+1 .\n\\]\n\nWith two kaons in the final state  \n\n\\[\nQ_{KK}=+2,\\quad B_{KK}=0,\\quad S_{KK}=+2 .\n\\]\n\nConservation of charge, baryon number and strangeness therefore requires  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ_{H}&=Q_{\\rm init}-Q_{KK}=+2-+2=0,\\\\[2mm]\nB_{H}&=B_{\\rm init}-B_{KK}=2-0=2,\\\\[2mm]\nS_{H}&=S_{\\rm init}-S_{KK}=0-(+2)=-2 .\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\]\n\nA baryon‑number of 2 means that at least **six valence quarks** are needed (the smallest colour–singlet configuration with \\(B=2\\)).  \nOne convenient assignment consistent with the quantum numbers is  \n\n\\[\nH\\sim u\\,u\\,d\\,d\\,s\\,s ,\n\\]\n\nso \\(H\\) is a doubly‑strange dibaryon (the famous “\\(H\\)-dibaryon”).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(b)   Beam momentum needed to reach the production threshold**\n\nLet the laboratory target proton be at rest.  \nDenote the incoming‐beam proton four‑momentum by \\((E,p)\\); the target proton has \\((m_{p},0)\\).\nThe centre‑of‑mass energy squared is  \n\n\\[\ns=(E+m_{p})^{2}-p^{2}=2m_{p}^{2}+2m_{p}E .\n\\]\n\nAt threshold the whole final system moves together, hence  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{s}_{\\text{thr}}=M_{\\text{fin}}\\equiv m_{H}+2m_{K}.\n\\]\n\nUsing \\(m_{p}=938.272\\ {\\rm MeV},\\; m_{K}=493.677\\ {\\rm MeV},\n\\; m_{H}=2150\\ {\\rm MeV}\\),\n\n\\[\nM_{\\text{fin}} = 2150+2\\times 493.677 = 3137.354\\ {\\rm MeV}.\n\\]\n\nSolving for the beam energy,\n\n\\[\nE=\\frac{M_{\\text{fin}}^{2}-2m_{p}^{2}}{2m_{p}}\n      =\\frac{(3137.354)^{2}-2(938.272)^{2}}{2(938.272)}\n      \\approx 4.307\\ {\\rm GeV}.\n\\]\n\nThe corresponding beam momentum is  \n\n\\[\np_{\\min }=\\sqrt{E^{2}-m_{p}^{2}}\n          \\approx \\sqrt{(4.307)^{2}-(0.938)^{2}}\\;{\\rm GeV}\n          \\approx 4.20\\ {\\rm GeV}/c .\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{p_{\\min }\\;\\simeq\\;4.2\\ {\\rm GeV}/c }\n\\]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(c)   Allowed decay modes of \\(H\\) (with \\(m_{H}=2150\\) MeV)**  \n\nAll strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions conserve baryon number,\nelectric charge and (for strong/e.m.) strangeness.  \n\n*Strong decays.*  \nAny strong decay must leave \\(B=2,\\;Q=0,\\;S=-2\\).  \nTypical two‑body candidates are  \n\n\\[\n\\Lambda\\Lambda\\;(m_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}=2\\times1115.68\\simeq2231\\ {\\rm MeV}),\\qquad\nN+\\Xi\\;(m_{p\\Xi^{-}}\\simeq2260\\ {\\rm MeV}),\n\\]\n\nboth having invariant masses **larger** than the assumed \\(m_{H}=2150\\) MeV.  \nConsequently **no open strong channel exists**, and the dibaryon is stable\nagainst strong breakup.\n\n*Electromagnetic decays.*  \nPhotons do not change strangeness, so an EM transition would still have to\nremove the two units of strangeness – impossible without violating\nconservation rules.

In lab frame S we have photon A traveling say along +x direction with energy ε; its momentum magnitude p=ε/c. Photon B travels opposite (-x) with energy E, momentum magnitude P=E/c but direction negative x. Total four-momentum:\n\nP_total = ( (ε+E)/c , (ε/c - E/c),0,0 ) if choose sign accordingly. Actually momentum vector sum: p_x total = ε/c - E/c because one positive, other negative. Want find boost speed β such that in new frame S' total spatial momentum zero. For Lorentz transformation along x axis: Energy transforms as γ(E_tot - β c p_x tot ), Momentum transforms as γ(p_x tot - β E_tot /c ). Set transformed momentum zero => p'_x = γ( p_x - β E_tot /c)=0 → β = p_x c / E_tot . Wait careful: p_x has units of momentum, E_tot is total energy. So β = p_x c^2/E_tot ? Let's compute dimensionless: Use natural units c=1 maybe easier. Then β = p_x / E_tot .\n\nGiven p_x = ε - E over c? Using c=1, momenta magnitudes equal energies. With signs: p_x = ε - E (since first photon + direction gives +ε, second gives -E). Thus β = (ε - E)/(ε+E). But they give β = (E - ε)/(E + ε). That's just minus sign due to definition of direction perhaps. Since β should be between -1 and 1; if E>ε then net momentum points towards higher-energy photon direction i.e., from lower to higher? Actually larger energy photon carries more momentum so net momentum toward it. To get rest frame where total momentum zero you need move in same direction as bigger momentum photon, thus β positive when E > ε. Our expression gave negative if using our orientation. Choose convention that β defined as velocity of frame relative to original where origin moves towards high-energy photon direction, giving β = (E-ε)/(E+ε).\n\nThus part (a) derived.\n\nNow part (b): Pair production threshold condition: invariant mass squared s = (p_γ1 + p_γ2)^2 ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2 = 4 m_e^2 c^4.\n\nFor two photons with energies ε and E colliding head-on, angle θ = π, so s = 2 ε E (1 - cosθ) = 2 ε E (1 - (-1)) = 4 ε E. Because in general s = 2 ε E (1 - cosθ) (using c=1). Therefore requirement: 4 ε E >= 4 m_e^2 ⇒ ε E >= m_e^2 c^4.\n\nSo minimal E = m_e^2 c^4 / ε.\n\nPlug numbers: electron rest mass m_e = 511 keV ≈ 5.11×10⁵ eV. Square: (5.11e5 eV)^2 = about 2.61 ×10¹¹ eV². Divide by ε = 1 eV yields ~2.6×10^{11} eV = 261 GeV.\n\nCompute precisely: (511000 eV)^2 = 2.61121e11 eV^2.

Net S = 0. So strangeness conserved overall. But also need other quantum numbers like isospin maybe? Reaction could proceed via strong interaction if allowed energetically. However threshold may be high due to masses: m_p≈938 MeV, m_K ≈494 MeV, m_Σ≈1197 MeV. Two protons mass ~1876 MeV. Sum final masses ~1691 MeV < initial rest mass! Wait that's less than initial, so exothermic? Actually 938*2=1876 > 494+1197=1691, so it's possible energetically without extra KE. Yet we don't see it because... perhaps requires creation of ss̄ pair which is okay under strong. Why not observed? Maybe because of parity/charge conjugation? Or more likely because this reaction violates conservation of something else: e.g., cannot happen as single-step strong process because you would need to produce both a kaon (meson) and hyperon simultaneously from two nucleons – that is allowed though. In practice such associated production occurs: pp → p Λ K+, known reaction. Indeed pp → p Λ K+ is observed. The given reaction produces Σ+ instead of Λ plus a proton. That should also occur: pp → Σ+ K+. I think indeed there is experimental observation of pp → Σ+ K+ near threshold. So why \"not observed\"? Perhaps they meant low-energy collisions where only few GeV? Hmm.\n\nMaybe the issue is that the reaction involves changing isospin too much? Check charges: left side total Q = +1+ +1 = +2. Right side: K+ (+1), Σ+ (+1) sum +2 OK. Baryon number: LHS 2, RHS: K+ meson B=0, Σ+ B=1, missing one baryon. That's wrong: We started with two protons (B=2). After reaction we have only one baryon Σ+ (B=1). Conservation of baryon number violated! Yes! Good catch. Reaction lacks second baryon. Should be p + p → K+ + Σ+ + p ? No. So reaction violates baryon number. Therefore impossible. Similarly others?\n\nCheck #2: p+n → Λ0 + Σ+. Initial B=2, final: Λ (B=1) + Σ+(B=1) total B=2 ok. Charge: p(+1)+n(0)=+1 ; Λ0(0)+ Σ+(+1)=+1 good. Strangeness: initial 0, final Λ(-1)+ Σ+ (-1) = -2 . Not conserved. So fails strangeness.

Strangeness: Ξ- S=-2, K+ S=+1, Σ+ S=-1 total S = -2+1-1 = -2 . Not zero, thus strangeness not conserved.

Charge: Σ+ +1 ; Λ0 0 + K+ +1 = +1 ok. Strangeness: Σ+ S=-1 , Λ0 S=-1, K+ S=+1 total S = -1+1 =0 while initial S=-1 . Violation of strangeness. Must involve weak interaction; however ΔS = +1 needed, which is allowed weakly? Weak changes |ΔS|=1 typical, but here net increase of +1 (from -1 to 0). This is allowed weakly, but lifetime? Might be kinematically prohibited? Mass difference: m_{Σ+}=1189 MeV, m_{Λ}=1116 MeV, m_K+=494 MeV sum =1610 MeV greater than parent mass, so can't satisfy energy-momentum.

", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to answer three parts about Σ*. The particle Σ* (likely Σ(1385)) has quark content uus, uds, dds depending charge states. Strangeness S = -1 because contains one strange quark s. Reaction K− p → π− Σ*+. Let's check quantum numbers:\n\nInitial: K− (s anti-u), proton (uud). Total strangeness initial: K− has S=-1 (since s quark gives S=-1; anti-s would give +1, but it's s anti-u so includes s => S=-1). Proton has S=0. So total S_initial = -1. Final: π− (no strangeness), Σ*+ presumably composition uus? Actually Σ*+ corresponds to charge +1, likely quark content uus (two up, one strange). That yields S = -1. Good. So consistent.\n\nSecond reaction K+ p -> π+ Σ*+, where K+ is (u anti-s): strangeness +1. Initial S = +1. Final π+ no strangeness, Σ*+ same as before S=-1, net change ΔS = -2 which cannot happen via strong interaction conserving strangeness. Therefore that reaction doesn't occur strongly. Could proceed via weak but suppressed etc. So explanation.\n\nThus part (a): strangeness of Σ* is –1.\n\nPart (b): Decay Σ*→π+ Λ . Check if strong allowed: Strong interactions conserve strangeness, baryon number, isospin approx. Σ* has S=-1, Λ also S=-1, pion S=0, so overall conserved. Also masses: mΣ*=1385 > mΛ≈1116 plus mπ ≈140 => sum ~1256 <1385, enough phase space. Width Γ~35 MeV typical for strong decays (~10–100 MeV). Weak decays have much longer lifetimes (Γ ~10^{-12} eV). Thus this decay is strong. Additionally high branching fraction 88% suggests dominant mode, characteristic of strong.\n\nSo answer: strong decay.\n\nPart (c): Determine isospin I of Σ*. Use info from production reactions. In K− p → π− Σ*+ , we can consider isospin coupling. Kaons belong to doublet (I=½); K− (I3 = −½). Proton I=½, I3=+½. Pion π− belongs to triplet I=1, I3 = −1. Σ*+ is member of Σ* multiplet (like Σ+, Σ0, Σ−). We know Σ hyperons form isotriplet I=1. For Σ*, similarly should be I=1. But confirm using selection rules: Since both initial state particles have I=½ each, their combined possible total is I_total = 0 or 1. Final state consists of π (I=1) and Σ* (unknown I_X). Coupling leads to possibilities. Given observed reaction occurs while analogous K+ p → π+ Σ*+ does not, indicates some isospin constraints maybe due to G-parity? However more straightforward: Σ hyperons known to have I=1. The fact that Σ*+ exists implies there are charged partners Σ*0, Σ*-; they were observed historically. So I=1.\n\nExplain: From reaction K−p → π− Σ*+: initial I combination could produce I=1 component leading to final I determined by addition of I_π=1 and I_{Σ*}=?. To get non-zero amplitude only when I_{Σ*}=1 such that total I matches. If Σ* had I=0 then final I would be just I_π=1, but initial I may include I=1 component still okay... Hmm better reasoning: Because Σ* appears together with its charge states forming an isotriplet, similar to ground-state Σ's. Moreover the absence of K+ p → π+ Σ*+ can be explained by conservation of strangeness rather than isospin. So perhaps use isospin symmetry of strong interaction: The two processes differ only by replacing K− (anti-strange) with K+ (strange). Since strangeness changes sign, the second process violates strangeness conservation thus forbidden; it tells nothing about isospin. Yet we might infer isospin from existence of Σ*+ being positively charged partner within triplet.\n\nAlternatively, we can argue using Clebsov-Gordan coefficients: The amplitudes for different charge combinations depend on isospin couplings. Observed relative rates indicate certain I values. With only one observed channel can't fully determine, but knowledge from SU(3) classification places Σ* in octet/decuplet? Wait Σ*(1385) is part of decuplet (spin-3/2) with I=1. Indeed the decuplet members: Δ (I=3/2), Σ* (I=1), Ξ* (I=1/2), Ω (I=0).

Wait \"single pion\" meaning charged current production: ν_l + N -> l^- + N' + π . For proton target: ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + p + π⁺? Actually charge conservation: initial charges: ν neutral, p (+1). Final lepton negative (-1), so net -1 plus hadrons should sum +1 => hadron system total +2. Options: μ⁻ + p + π⁰ gives charges: -1 +1 +0 =0 mismatch. Need overall +1. Let's think standard CC resonant Δ++ production: ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + Δ^{++}, then Δ^{++}->p+π+. So reaction: ν_ℓ + p → ℓ⁻ + p + π⁺ . That works: charges: left side +1 ; right side: lepton -1, proton +1, pi+ +1 totals +1. Good.\n\nWith neutron target: ν_ℓ + n → ℓ⁻ + p + π⁰ or ν_ℓ + n → ℓ⁻ + n + π⁺?

Also consider whether interactions type possible: electromagnetic, weak, strong. Let's list:\n\n1) μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ . Initial muon plus has charge +1, lepton numbers: muon lepton number L_μ = -1? Actually convention: Lepton number per flavor: For particle, lepton number = +1 for leptons, -1 for antileptons. Muon (+) is anti-muon? Wait µ⁺ is antiparticle of µ⁻. So it carries lepton number L_µ = -1 (since it's an antimuon). Electron positron e⁺ is anti-electron => electron lepton number L_e = -1. Photon no lepton number. Charge: initial +1, final +1 (positron + photon neutral). So charge ok. But lepton flavour numbers: we have change from muon lepton number -1 to electron lepton number -1. That violates separate lepton family numbers unless neutrinos present to balance. In SM, total lepton number is conserved (sum over flavors). Here sum before: L_total = -1 (from µ⁺). After: -1 (from e⁺). So total lepton number same! However individual flavor numbers not conserved: ΔL_mu = +1 (since lost antimuon?) Actually starting with antimuon gives L_μ=-1 ; after none -> net increase of +1? Wait compute: Before: L_μ = -1, L_e=0. After: L_μ=0, L_e=-1. Total L = -1 both sides. So overall lepton number okay, but lepton flavor changes without accompanying neutrino – this process would require lepton-flavor violating interaction which does not occur at tree level in Standard Model (only via loops suppressed extremely). Is it forbidden by any exact symmetry? Individual lepton flavours are accidental symmetries broken only by neutrino mixing (which allows tiny LFV). The decay µ→eγ is highly suppressed but experimentally limited (<4.2×10^{-13}). It's effectively prohibited at observable rates. So considered violation of lepton flavor conservation (ΔLe ≠0, ΔLμ≠0). So yes violates lepton-family-number conservation.\n\nAlso check spin/angular momentum: µ (spin½) decays into e⁺(½)+photon(1); can conserve angular momentum.\n\nThus #1 violates lepton flavor conservation (or more precisely charged lepton flavor).\n\n2) e⁻ → ν_e + γ . Initial electron charge -1, lepton number L_e = +1. Final: neutrino ν_e (charge 0, L_e=+1) + photon (neutral). Charge not conserved: left side -1, right side 0. So violates electric charge conservation. Also lepton number fine. So illegal due to charge non-conservation.\n\n3) p + p → p + Σ⁺ + K⁻ . Check charges: Left: two protons each +1 => total +2. Right: proton +1, Sigma-plus +1, Kaon minus -1 => total +1. That's mismatch: +2 vs +1. So charge not conserved. Baryon number: left: each proton B=1 so total 2. Right: proton B=1, Σ⁺ (baryon) B=1, K⁻ meson B=0 => total 2 OK. Strangeness: Σ⁺ contains s quark? Σ⁺ composition uus, S = -1 (strange quantum number defined as negative of strange quark count?). Usually strangeness S = -(number of strange quarks) + (anti-strange). Σ⁺ has one s quark thus S = -1. K⁻ (s̄ u) has S = +1. Sum S on RHS = (-1)+(+1)=0 matches LHS zero. So main issue is charge. Therefore violates charge conservation.\n\nBut could also think about other laws like lepton number irrelevant.\n\nSo #3 violates electric charge.\n\n4) p → e⁺ + ν_e . Proton charge +1. Positron +1, neutrino 0 => total +1, charge conserved. Baryon number: initial B=1, final particles: e⁺ B=0, ν_e B=0 => B=0 final, violation of baryon number. Lepton number: initial L=0, final: e⁺ (antipositron) L_e = -1, ν_e L_e = +1 total 0, okay. So violates baryon number conservation (and possibly requires something else like proton decay). This reaction also violates energy because mass difference? Proton mass ~938 MeV, e⁺+ν_e combined less than that, but missing anything else? Could produce gamma to carry away rest? Not required. Anyway primary violation is baryon number.\n\n5) p → e⁺ + n + ν_e . Charges: p +1, e⁺ +1, n 0, ν 0 => total +1 good. Baryon number: initial 1, final neutron 1, others 0 => total 1, conserved. Lepton number: final e⁺ (-1) + ν_e(+1) =0, ok. Energy/mass: m_p = 938.27 MeV, m_n =939.57 MeV heavier, cannot happen spontaneously because final mass > initial, violates energy conservation (cannot satisfy kinematics). Unless external source. So violates energy/mass (kinematic impossibility). Also may violate some selection rule? Reaction resembles beta-plus decay of free proton, which is energetically forbidden because Q<0. So violation of energy conservation / can't proceed spontaneously.\n\n6) n → p + e⁻ + \\bar{ν}_e . Classic beta decay. Check charges: n 0, p +1, e⁻ -1, antineutrino 0 => total 0, ok. Baryon number: 1->1, ok. Lepton number: e⁻ L_e=+1, antinu L_e = -1 total 0, ok. Energy: neutron slightly heavier than proton+electron (~939.565 vs 938.272+0.511=938.783) leaving kinetic energy ~0.78 MeV, allowed. So allowed, respects all conservations. So no violation.\n\n7) π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ . Pion charge +1, muon +1, neutrino 0, ok. Baryon number 0 throughout. Lepton number: muon +1, neutrino +1? Wait muon lepton number: μ⁺ is antimuon, L_μ = -1. Neutrino ν_μ has L_μ = +1, sum 0 equals initial 0. Good. Energy: pion mass 139.6 MeV, muon 105.66 MeV, neutrino negligible, leaves KE ~33.9 MeV, allowed. So allowed.\n\nNow summarise which violate: #1 lepton flavor conservation (charged lepton flavor), #2 electric charge, #3 electric charge, #4 baryon number, #5 energy (mass-energy) i.e., kinematic forbiddance, #6 none, #7 none.\n\nPotentially also note that #1 violates lepton family number (individual lepton numbers) though total lepton number conserved.

Usually natural linewidth Γ = ℏ/τ ; that's the full width at half maximum. So answer: ΔM≈ℏ(γ1+γ2)/c².\n\nPart (b): Strong interaction conserves isospin I and its third component Iz. The final state π⁺π⁺ system: each pion is iso-triplet (I=1), charge + corresponds to I3=+1. Two pions combine symmetrically because they are identical bosons (both π⁺). Need possible total isospin values from addition of two I=1 particles: I_tot =0,1,2. But symmetry constraints: For two identical charged pions, overall wavefunction symmetric under exchange. Spatial part likely even L? Not specified but near threshold maybe s-wave (L=0) which is symmetric spatially. Pion internal states also symmetric? Isospin part must then be symmetric as well because total wavefunction for bosons must be symmetric. Since spatial symmetric, spin zero (pseudoscalar) so no spin factor. Therefore isospin part must be symmetric => only I=2 (symmetric) allowed, not I=0 (antisymmetric?) Actually combination of two I=1 gives decomposition: Symmetric representation includes I=2 and I=0? Let's recall SU(2) product: 1⊗1 = 0 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 2. Under interchange, the I=2 and I=0 states are symmetric while I=1 is antisymmetric? Check Clebsch-Gordan: For two identical bosons, the combined isospin wavefunction should be symmetric if orbital angular momentum is even. The I=0 state is totally antisymmetric under exchange? Wait we examine basis |I,m>. Exchange operator swaps labels; for two identical particles, the symmetric combinations correspond to even I? Actually for two spin-1 objects, the symmetric subspace dimension =6 corresponding to I=2 (dim5) plus one more symmetric piece? Hmm.\n\nLet's compute using CG coefficients: State |I=0,M=0> ∝ (|+ - > - |- + > - |00>)?? That's antisymmetric? Might be fully antisymmetric. Indeed for two triplets, the singlet is antisymmetric. The quintet I=2 is symmetric. The triplet I=1 is mixed symmetry (neither fully symmetric nor antisymmetric). Thus for identical charges (+,+) there is only one way: both have m=+1. This belongs purely to I=2 multiplet (since M=+2 cannot arise from I<2). Because max projection equals total I. So the pair π⁺π⁺ must be in I=2 state. Hence initial X must have same isospin I=2 (and I₃=+2). However strong decays conserve isospin magnitude but may allow mixing? Typically yes, strong interactions preserve isospin exactly. So X's isospin must be I=2, I3=+2.\n\nThus conclusion: X has isospin I=2 (or possibly higher that contains I3=+2?). Minimal is I≥2.

Then describe μ+ decay: μ+ → e+ ν_e anti-ν_μ . Actually positive muon decays into positron, electron-neutrino, antimuon-neutrino.\n\nThen consider reaction ν_mu + n -> e- + p being forbidden; we need assign lepton numbers such that it violates some conserved quantity. Usually lepton family numbers L_e, L_mu etc. Reaction would have initial L_e=0, L_mu =1 ; final has L_e=1, L_mu=0 => not allowed if separate family numbers conserved. But total lepton number is conserved (both sides sum to 1). So forbiddance suggests individual flavor numbers are conserved in weak interactions (at least historically). However later discovered neutrino oscillations violate them but still overall L conserved.\n\nThus propose assignment: each lepton carries its own lepton number: Le(e-) = +1, Le(νe)=+1, Lμ(μ- )=+1, Lμ(νμ) = +1, similarly τ. Antileptons carry -1. This makes μ+ decay conserve both families: μ+ (Lμ=-1) decays to e+ (Le=-1), ν_e (+1), anti-ν_μ (-1?) Wait check signs: For antiparticles opposite sign. In standard convention: lepton number L assigned +1 to particles, -1 to antiparticles. So μ+ is antiparticle of μ-, so Lμ = -1. Decay products: e+ (antiparticle of e-): Le = -1, ν_e : Le = +1, anti-ν_μ : Lμ = -1. Sum Lμ = -1 from μ+, then -1 from anti-ν_μ gives -2? Let's compute correctly: Initial Lμ = -1 (since it's μ+). Final: ν_e no muon number, anti-ν_μ contributes -1, e+ none. Total Lμ_final = -1 matches. Electron family: initial Le=0, final Le = -1 (e+) + +1 (ν_e) =0.

The process ν_μ + N -> ℓ'⁻ + X where ℓ' carries muon family number? Or perhaps ν_μ interacts producing µ− directly (inverse beta)? Actually ν_μ can produce μ- when interacting with nucleon above threshold: ν_µ + n → µ‑ + p (charged current). That's observed. To get a new heavy lepton, you need enough energy > mass difference, and the interaction proceeds via W exchange conserving lepton family number: ν_µ converts to corresponding charged lepton ℓ_µ⁻ (the muon). A heavier lepton would require different lepton number assignment (maybe a new family).\n\nSo answer: propose existence of another lepton doublet (ℓ_H , ν_H) with its own lepton number L_H, allowing ν_µ to convert to ℓ_H⁺ (?) Not sure.\n\nBetter: Since ν_µ cannot turn into e⁻ due to family number, it could instead turn into a yet unknown heavy charged lepton carrying muon-number, call μ′⁻, provided m_{μ'} < E_ν - binding energies.

{"id": "atomic/4-39", "questions": "The universe is filled with black-body microwave radiation. The average photon energy is $E \\sim 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.

(Assume photon-proton scattering to be too small to be important.)  ", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to compute threshold condition for gamma + background photon -> e+ e-. Pair production requires center-of-mass energy >= 2 m_e c^2.\n\nFor two photons colliding head-on, invariant s = 2 E_gamma ε (1 - cosθ). For worst case θ=π => factor 2. Actually s = 2 Eγ ε (1 - cosθ). Threshold when sqrt(s)=2m_ec^2 → s = (2 m_e c^2)^2 = 4 m_e^2 c^4.\n\nThus required product: 2 Eγ ε (1 - cosθ) ≥ 4 m_e^2 c^4 ⇒ Eγ ε ≥ 2 m_e^2 c^4 / (1 - cosθ).\n\nMaximum (head on): (1-cosθ)=2 so denominator 2 gives Eγ ε ≥ m_e^2 c^4 . So threshold: E_thr = (m_e^2 c^4)/ε .\n\nGiven typical CMB photon energy ~ 10^-3 eV. Convert m_e c^2 ≈511 keV = 5.11×10^5 eV. Square: (5.11×10^5 eV)^2 = 2.61 ×10^11 eV^2. Divide by ε=10^-3 eV yields about 2.6×10^14 eV = 260 TeV. That's threshold; higher energies will interact efficiently.\n\nBut we also consider mean free path λ = 1/(n σ), n~300 cm⁻³ = 300 *10^6 m⁻³? Wait conversion: 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³, so per cubic meter it's 300*1e6 = 3e8 m⁻³. Cross-section sigma≈σ_T/3 ; Thomson cross-section σ_T = (8π/3) r_e². Classical electron radius r_e = e²/(mc²) ≈ 2.818×10⁻¹⁵ m. Compute σ_T = (8π/3)*(2.818e-15)² = let's calculate quickly using python mental: (2.818e-15)² =7.94e-30. Multiply by 8π/3 ≈ (8*3.1416)/3 = 8.377... approx 8.38. Then σ_T ≈ 8.38 * 7.94e-30 = 66.5e-30 =6.65e-29 m². Indeed known value: σ_T = 6.652e-29 m². Good. So σ = σ_T/3 ≈ 2.22e-29 m².\n\nMean free path λ = 1/(n σ) = 1 /(3e8 * 2.22e-29 ) = 1 / (6.66e-21) = 1.5e20 m. Let's compute more precisely: 3e8 * 2.22e-29 = 6.66e-21. Inverse = 1.50e20 m.\n\nConvert to light years or parsecs: 1 ly = 9.46e15 m. So λ ≈ 1.5e20 / 9.46e15 = 15860 ly ≈ 1.6×10^4 ly. Also convert to Mpc: 1 pc = 3.086e16 m, thus λ = 1.5e20 / 3.09e16 = 4850 pc = 4.85 kpc. Hmm that's smaller than galaxy scale (~30kly). Wait check numbers: 1 pc = 3.086e16 m, dividing gives 4860 pc = 4.86 kpc which is ~16000 ly indeed. That seems plausible.\n\nNow part (a): what energy γ-rays would have lifetimes limited by this process? Means those above threshold such that interaction probability significant over Hubble time maybe. Use optical depth τ = d/λ. Lifetime comparable to age of Universe t_U ~ 13.8 Gyr = 4.35e17 s. Travel speed near c, distance traveled L=c*t_U ≈ 3e8 * 4.35e17 = 1.305e26 m. Compare to λ =1.5e20 m, ratio ~ 8.7e5. Thus many interactions; but actually after first interaction they're gone. So any gamma > threshold will be attenuated within relatively short distances compared to cosmic scales. But perhaps ask \"what energy gamma rays would have their lifetimes limited\" meaning find energy where cross-section becomes effective i.e., threshold derived earlier: around 250 TeV. Could mention due to exponential tail distribution etc. Might say roughly >100 TeV.\n\nPart (b) average distance travel before converting: λ computed as ~1.5×10^20 m ≈ 5 kpc ≈ 1.6×10^4 ly.\n\nPart (c) compare with size of universe: observable radius ~ 14 Gpc ≈ 4.3×10^26 m. Ratio λ/universe size ~ 1.5e20 / 4.3e26 = 3.5e-7. So much smaller; essentially cannot traverse cosmological distances.\n\nAlternatively could express as fraction of horizon length ~ few millionths.\n\nPart (d) Ultra-high-energy proton interacts via photopion production (Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin effect). Process p + γ_CMB → Δ+ → p π⁰ or n π+. Energy threshold similar: require centre-of-mass enough to produce pion mass. Condition: E_p ε ≥ (m_π m_p c^4 + ... ), approximate threshold ~5×10^19 eV for CMB photons. So answer: photo-pion production leading to GZK cut-off limiting propagation distance to ∼50 Mpc.\n\nLet's craft detailed reasoning steps.\n\nCompute threshold for proton:\n\nIn lab frame (CMB rest), threshold given by (s - m_p^2 c^4)≥(m_π + m_n?) Actually reaction p + γ → Δ resonance then decays. Approx formula: E_th ≈ (m_π c^2)(m_p c^2 + m_π/2)/ε ≈ 5×10^19 eV for ε∼6×10⁻⁴ eV (average CMB).

Actually effective four-fermion coupling G_F ≈ 1.166×10⁻⁵ GeV⁻². For kaon decays, amplitudes ∝ G_F V_us V_ud... So rate scales like G_F^2 m_K^5 (phase space), with additional Cabibbo suppression sinθc.\n\nLeptonic decays: also proportional to G_F^2 m_l^2 f_P^2 due to helicity suppression.\n\nThus compute ratios.\n\nWe'll assume masses similar so phase-space cancels unless drastically different.\n\nNow evaluate each.\n\n(a) Ratio K+ → π+π0 vs K_S^0 → π+π-. Both are ΔI = 1/2 rule? The first is charged Kaon decaying via weak interaction (non-leptonic). K+ -> π+π0 has I=3/2 component suppressed compared to K0->π+π-, which proceeds mainly through ΔI=1/2. Empirically Br(K+→π+π0)=20.7% ; Br(KS→π+π-) about 69%. But total widths differ: lifetimes τ_{K+}=1.24e-8 s, τ_{KS}=0.89e-10 s (much shorter). However they ask ratio of partial widths not branching fractions maybe. Use known values: Γ_partial = BR/τ. Compute approximate ratio.\n\nΓ(K+)π+π0 = B(K+→π+π0)/τ_K+. B≈0.207, τ≈1.238e-8 => Γ≈0.207/(1.238e-8)=1.67e7 s⁻¹.\n\nFor KS: B(KS→π+π- )≈0.692, τ≈0.895e-10=> Γ≈0.692/(8.95e-11)=7.73e9 s⁻¹.\n\nRatio = 1.67e7 / 7.73e9 ≈ 2.16e-3.\n\nSo around 2×10⁻³. This reflects both lifetime difference (ΔI=1/2 enhancement for neutral) and possibly CP violation small.\n\nSelection rules: Non-leptonic weak ΔS=1, ΔQ = ΔS (for K+?), Isospin change allowed. Fundamental: strangeness changes by one unit via weak interaction; parity conserved? Not relevant. Phenomenologically: ΔI=1/2 rule enhances K0 decays over K+, giving factor ~20.\n\nHence ratio ~ O(10⁻³).\n\nExpress in terms of sinθc? Both involve same CKM product V_us V_ud ~ sinθc cosθc . No extra suppression. Lifetime difference arises from mixing: K_S short-lived because it can decay strongly? Actually it's still weak but larger matrix element due to ΔI=1/2. So ratio ~ (A_{3/2}/A_{1/2})^2 where A_{3/2}~1/20 of A_{1/2}. So ratio ~(1/20)^2≈1/400≈2.5×10⁻³ consistent.\n\nThus answer.\n\n(b) ρ0 → π0π0 versus ρ0 → π+π−. Strong decays. Isospin considerations: ρ (I=1) decays into two pions (total I can be 0 or 2?). Two-pion system symmetric under exchange leads to even isospin only (since L=1 gives odd spatial wavefunction, overall antisymmetric requires isospin odd?) Let's recall: ρ (J^P=1^−) decays to two pseudoscalars in P-wave (L=1). Since identical bosons require symmetrization. For π0π0 (identical) the combined isospin must be I=0 or 2? Wait: two pion states decomposition: |ππ,I,M>. Symmetric under particle interchange corresponds to even I (0,2). Antisymmetric would be odd I (1). Because exchanging particles flips sign (-1)^L(-1)^I? For L=1 (odd), overall symmetry demands isospin odd (I=1) to make total symmetric? Need check: Bose statistics: Wavefunction = (-1)^L * (-1)^I (due to isospin part being symmetric for even I). Must be +1. Thus (-1)^L*(-1)^I = +1 ⇒ (-1)^{L+I}=+1 ⇒ L+I even. With L=1, then I must be odd (1). Therefore two-pion system from vector meson must be I=1. But π0π0 cannot form I=1 because combination of two identical neutral pions yields only I=0,2 (even). Hence forbidden by isospin conservation. So ρ0→π0π0 is prohibited (strongly). It could proceed electromagnetically via ω–ρ mixing? Very tiny. So ratio essentially zero, perhaps of order α^2 or (m_d - m_u)^2 leading to isospin breaking ~ (δm/m)^2 ~ few percent squared ~10⁻⁴. Real experimental limit: Branching fraction < 1.6×10⁻⁴. So ratio ~~<10⁻⁴.\n\nThus answer: approx ≤10⁻⁴, effectively zero. Selection rule: isospin conservation (strong); if broken, electromagnetic mixing provides suppression α.\n\nInteraction: strong for allowed channel, EM-suppressed for forbidden.\n\n(c) K_L → μ+μ- vs K_L → π0π0. First process is rare flavor-changing neutral current loop-induced weak (second-order weak) plus long-distance contributions; second is dominant CP-conserving decay via weak (ΔS=1) but actually K_L (mostly CP=-1) decays to two pions (CP=+1) highly suppressed—actually K_L → π0π0 occurs via indirect CP violation, branching ~ 9×10⁻⁴. While K_L → μ+μ- branching ~ 7×10⁻⁹. Ratio ~ 7e-9 / 9e-4 ≈ 8e-6. Roughly 10⁻⁵.\n\nExplain: K_L → π0π0 is weak ΔS=1, CP violating (suppressed by ε∼10⁻³). Rate ∝ G_F^2 sin^2θc … times ε^2. K_L → μ+μ- proceeds via second-order weak (box/penguin) with further α_em suppression and also helicity suppression? Actually no lepton mass enters. Effective Hamiltonian includes G_F α / (π) term. Overall magnitude ~ G_F^2 α^2 m_K^5. Compare orders: ratio ~ (α^2)/(ε^2) * (phase space differences). Using numbers: α≈1/137, α^2≈5×10⁻⁵; ε≈2.2×10⁻³, ε^2≈5×10⁶? wait square: (2.2e-3)^2≈5e-6. Then α^2/ε^2≈ (5e-5)/(5e-6)=10. Hmm not right. Additional loop factor (1/16π^2) reduces muon mode more. So net ratio ~10⁻⁵ matches data.\n\nProvide expression: Γ(μμ) ~ (G_F^2 α^2 m_K^5)/(256π^3) , Γ(ππ) ~ ε^2 G_F^2 sin^2θc cos^2θc m_K^5 /(64π). Ratio ≈ (α^2/(4π^2))/ (ε^2) ≈ (5e-5/(40)) / (5e-6)??? Might produce ~10⁻⁵.\n\nWill present.\n\n(d) K+ → π+π+ e- ν vs K- → π+π- e- ν. These are semileptonic Kℓ4 decays. Charge conjugation: K+ (s̄ u) decays to π+π+ e- ν_e (ΔS=1, ΔQ = -1). K- (s ū) decays to π+π- e- ν_e? Wait charge mismatch: K- contains s anti-u, decays to π+π- e- ν? That violates charge? Actually K- → π+π-e-ν̅_e? Usually K- → π+π- e- ν̅_e (Ke4). Provided reaction may be miswritten. Assuming compare K+ (positive) vs K- (negative) modes. In absence of CP violation, rates equal. Any asymmetry comes from direct CP violation (ΔI=1/2) small ~10⁻³. So ratio ≈1 within 10⁻³. Interaction: weak semi-leptonic (first order), governed by G_F and CKM V_us.\n\nThus ratio ~1.\n\n(e) Ω- → Σ- π0 vs Ω- → Ξ0 π-. Both strong decays? Ω- (sss) decays weakly because needs change of strangeness? Actually Ω- decays weakly (lifetime ~0.82e-10 s). Decay modes: primary is Ω- → Λ K- (weak), also Ξ0 π- (dominant) with branching ~23%, Σ- π0 smaller ~12%? Check PDG: Ω- → Ξ0 π- (BR≈43%), Ω- → Ξ- π0 (BR≈25%). Σ- π0 is doubly suppressed because involves ΔS=1 but also isospin? Actually transition Ω(sss) → Σ-(dds)+π0(uū-d d̄)/√2 requires changing two strange quarks to down, i.e., ΔS=2, thus second-order weak, heavily suppressed. So ratio very small, maybe ~10⁻³.\n\nFundamental rule: Strangeness change per weak vertex ΔS=±1. Single weak decay allows only one s→u/d conversion. To get Σ- you need convert two s's, requiring either W-exchange internal loops (higher order) hence suppressed by another factor G_F m_K^2 / (4π) ~10⁻⁷? Estimate ratio ~10⁻⁴ –10⁻⁵.\n\nThus answer: extremely small.\n\n(f) η → π+π- vs η → π+π-π0. First is CP violating strong/electromagnetic? η (I=0) decaying to two pions (I=0 or 1) violates C-parity? Actually η (C=+1) to ππ (C=+1) okay, but angular momentum constraints: η (0^-) to two pseudoscalar S-wave (L=0) gives J^PC = 0^++. Parities mismatched? η has negative parity, two pseudoscalars give positive parity (since intrinsic parities multiply (+)(+)=+, orbital L contributes (-1)^L). For L=0 parity = +, not match. Needs L=1 (odd) giving parity -, but two identical bosons can't have L odd due to Bose symmetry (they're distinguishable charges though). Still overall CP forbids. So η→ππ is forbidden by isospin & CP; observed branching <1.3×10⁻⁵. Meanwhile η→3π is allowed but suppressed by isospin-breaking (difference between up/down masses) since η is mostly SU(3) octet; this decay proceeds via strong interaction but violated isospin, giving width ~few keV vs total width 1.31 keV? Actually η total width 1.31 keV, main branch is 3π (about 70%). So ratio η→2π / η→3π ~10⁻⁴.\n\nThus answer: ~10⁻⁴ (or less). Rule: Conservation of G-parity (or isospin) prohibits 2π; three-pion allowed via isospin breaking (mass difference) making it suppressed by (m_d - m_u)^2 /Λ_QCD^2 ~10⁻².\n\nInteraction: both strong (but 2π effectively electromagnetic/isospin violating). So ratio ~α^2? Could say ~ (α/π)^2 ~10⁻⁵.\n\n(g) Λ → K- π+ vs Λ → p π-. Λ (uds) decays weakly (strange baryon). Primary mode is Λ → p π- (branching ~63%). Mode Λ → K- π+ is kinematically impossible? Masses: Λ 1115 MeV, K- 494, π+ 140 sum 634 <1115 yes possible. But requires creation of extra ssbar pair? Actually initial uds to final s̄ u (K-) + uud(p)? That's ΔS = ? Initial S=-1, final K- carries S=-1, proton S=0, net S unchanged, ok. Quark-level: ud s → (s̄ u)+(uud). Requires popping a u ū pair? It's a weak decay with spectator diquark? Likely suppressed relative to simple two-body pπ- because needs additional q-qbar production (W emission producing u¯d turning s→u...). Expect ratio ~O(10⁻³). Indeed experimentally branching for Λ → N K is negligible (<10⁻⁴). So ratio ~10⁻⁴.\n\nRule: Weak nonleptonic ΔS=1, but need color-favored external W-emission vs internal? The favored mode is s → u + W- followed by W- → d ¯u forming π-. For K-π+ you'd need s → u + W- then W- → s ¯u (producing K- ), while remaining u d combine to π+. This is Cabibbo suppressed? Both involve V_us V_ud combos similar. However phase space reduced? Slightly bigger masses reduce. Yet actual suppression likely due to needing creation of extra s¯s? hmm.\n\nI'll just give estimate ~10⁻³.\n\n(h) θ^0 → π+π-π0 vs ω^0 → π+π-π0. Here θ refers to \"phi\"? Maybe theta meson (f2?) Actually θ^0 might denote φ? Or maybe \"η'?\" I'm think they mean \"θ\" as the hypothetical isoscalar partner of ω? Possibly referring to \"φ\" (the hidden-strangeness vector meson). Typically φ → 3π is OZI suppressed, whereas ω → 3π dominates (BR~89%). Ratio φ→3π / ω→3π ~ (mixing angle)^2 ~ tan^2 δ where δ ~ 3° (SU(3) mixing). So ratio ~ (sinδ)^2 ≈ (0.05)^2 ≈ 2.5×10⁻³. Additionally EM contribution adds α^2? Observed branching φ→π+π-π0 ≈ 15%? Wait phi decays primarily to KK (84%) and 3π (15%). Actually φ→π+π-π0 branching ~ 15% indeed! Let’s verify: According to PDG, φ→π+π-π0 is about 15%; ω→π+π-π0 is 89%. Ratio ≈0.17. That's not tiny. But OZI suppression moderate. Perhaps θ denotes \"a1\"? Unclear. We'll treat as ω (isosvector) vs θ (isoscalar) mixture. The rule: Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule suppresses φ (almost pure s s-bar) decaying to non-strange pions; suppression factor ~tan^2(θ_V) where ideal mixing angle deviation ~3°. Gives ratio ~0.01. So I'll propose ~10⁻2.\n\n(i) Σ- → Λ0 π- vs Σ- → n π-. Σ- (dds) decays weakly. Main mode Σ- → n π- (BR≈100%?). Actually Σ- decays almost exclusively to n π- (99.85%). Decay to Λ π- is kinematically forbidden? Σ- mass 1197 MeV, Λ 1115 MeV, π- 139 MeV sum 1254 >1197, so not allowed energetically. So ratio essentially zero. If considered virtual, suppressed enormously. So ratio ≈0.\n\nBut maybe they meant Σ*? Anyway answer zero.\n\n(j) π- → e- ν vs K+ → μ+ ν. Both leptonic weak decays mediated by axial currents. Width formula: Γ(P→ℓν) = (G_F^2 |V_qq'|^2 f_P^2 m_ℓ^2 m_P (1 - m_ℓ^2/m_P^2)^2)/(8π). Ratio = [f_π^2 m_π m_e^2 (1 - m_e^2/m_π^2)^2] / [f_K^2 m_K m_μ^2 (1 - m_μ^2/m_K^2)^2 ] * (|V_ud|^2 / |V_us|^2). Take f_π≈130 MeV, f_K≈160 MeV, V_ud≈cosθc≈0.974, V_us≈sinθc≈0.225. Plug numbers: numerator: f_π^2≈16900, m_π≈140 MeV, m_e^2≈(0.511 MeV)^2≈0.261, factor (1 - ...)≈1. Denominator: f_K^2≈25600, m_K≈494 MeV, m_μ^2≈105.66^2≈11180, (1 - m_μ^2/m_K^2)^2=(1 - 11180/244036)^2≈(1 -0.0458)^2≈0.91. Multiply: denominator value ≈25600*494*11180*0.91 ≈ let's compute: 25600*494≈12646400; times 11180≈1.415e11; times 0.91≈1.288e11. Numerator: 16900*140*0.261≈16900*36.54≈617k ≈6.17e5. Ratio ≈6.2e5 /1.29e11 ≈4.8e-6. Times CKM ratio (0.974^2 /0.225^2) ≈ (0.949)/(0.0506)≈18.75. Multiply gives ≈9.0e-5. Actual measured ratio: Γ(π→eν)/Γ(K→µν) ≈ (1.235e-4)/(something) ???

Let's compute: 938.272^2 = (938 +0.272)^2 = 938^2 +2*938*0.272 +0.272^2 = 879,844 + 510.592 +0.074 = 880,354.666. Approx.\n\nNow sum m_π^2 + m_p^2 ≈ 19,480 + 880,355 = 899,835 MeV^2.\n\nSubtract from s_thr: 2,918,794 - 899,835 = 2,018,959 MeV^2.\n\nDivide by 2 m_p = 2*938.272 = 1876.544 MeV.\n\nE_lab_thresh = 2,018,959 / 1876.544 ≈ 1076.9 MeV.\n\nThat's total energy of pion (including its rest mass), so kinetic T = E - m_π = 1076.9 - 139.57 = 937.3 MeV.\n\nTherefore threshold kinetic energy around 940 MeV (~1 GeV). Could present both.\n\nc) Production cross-section σ = 1 mb = 1e-27 cm^2. Target thickness L = 30 cm. Density ρ_H2 = 0.07 g/cm³. Molar mass of H₂ = 2.016 g/mol. Number density n = (density)/(mass per molecule)*Avogadro's number.\n\nNumber of protons per volume? Since it's molecular hydrogen, each molecule has two protons (hydrogen nuclei). For scattering off protons, effective nucleon count double molecules.\n\nn_molecules = ρ / (M) * N_A = 0.07 g/cm³ / 2.016 g/mol * 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ = (0.034722... ) *6.022e23 = 2.09e22 molecules/cm³.\n\nTimes 2 protons per molecule yields n_proton = 4.18e22 cm⁻³.\n\nTarget thickness t = 30 cm, thus column density N = n_proton * t = 4.18e22 *30 = 1.254e24 protons/cm².\n\nProbability per incident pion to interact via this channel = σ * N = 1e-27 * 1.254e24 = 1.254e-3 = 0.00125 i.e., 0.125%.\n\nHence average number of rho0 per incident pi- equals probability assuming one interaction leads to rho0 (cross-section given already for rho0 production). So expected value = 1.25 x 10^{-3}.\n\nd) We have rho0 moving forward with energy 5 GeV, decays isotropically in its rest frame into two pions of equal mass m_pi = 139.57 MeV. In rho rest frame, momenta magnitude p* determined by two-body decay: p* = λ^{1/2}(m_rho^2,m_pi^2,m_pi^2)/ (2 m_rho). Where λ(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+z^2-2xy-2xz-2yz.\n\nSince identical masses, simplifies: p* = √[ (m_rho^2/4)- m_pi^2 ]. Because in rest frame energies each = m_rho/2, momentum squared = (m_rho/2)^2 - m_pi^2.\n\nCalculate: m_rho/2 = 384.5 MeV. Square =147,846 MeV^2. Subtract m_pi^2~19,480 =>128,366 MeV^2. Take sqrt: p* ≈ 358.3 MeV/c.\n\nCorresponding speed beta_star = p*/E*_pi where E*_pi=m_rho/2 =384.5 MeV. So β_* = 358.3/384.5 =0.932.\n\nGamma_* = 1/√(1-β_*^2) = 1/√(1-0.868) = 1/√(0.132) = 1/0.363 = 2.75 roughly. Check: indeed.\n\nNow boost along z-direction with Lorentz factor γ_R = E_R/m_R = 5GeV/0.769GeV = 6.50 computed earlier. Beta_R = √(1-1/γ^2)=0.988.\n\nIn R rest frame, consider emission angles θ* relative to boost axis (forward direction). The lab angle θ satisfies tanθ = sinθ* / (γ_R (cosθ* + β_R * (E*_π/p*) )) ??? Wait transformation of four-momentum.\n\nFour-vector in rest frame: (E*, p* sinθ*, 0, p* cosθ* ). Boost along z with velocity β_R, γ_R.\n\nLab components: \nE = γ_R(E* + β_R p* cosθ*)\np_z = γ_R(p* cosθ* + β_R E*)\np_x = p* sinθ*\nThen transverse momentum unchanged.\n\nAngle in lab defined by tanθ_lab = p_T / p_z = p* sinθ* / [γ_R(p* cosθ* + β_R E*)].\n\nMinimum opening angle between the two pions corresponds to case where they emerge back-to-back in rho rest frame (θ* for one is α, other is π-α). After boosting, their directions become closer together if emitted opposite to motion? To find smallest separation angle between them in lab, choose configuration that makes them most collinear after boost – likely when one goes forward (θ*=0) and the other backward (θ*=π). But then after boost, the backward-going pion may still go forward depending on boost strength; there will be some angle between them.\n\nWe want opening angle Δφ between the two lab three-vectors. Using symmetry, take first pion emitted at polar angle θ* w.r.t boost direction; second at π-θ*. Their transverse momenta magnitudes are equal: p_T = p* sinθ*. Longitudinal components differ sign.\n\nFor pion A (θ*): p_zA = γ_R(p* cosθ* + β_R E*)\n\nPion B (π-θ*): cos(π-θ*) = -cosθ*. Its longitudinal component: p_zB = γ_R(-p* cosθ* + β_R E*)\n\nTransverse components: p_TA = p_TB = p* sinθ* (but opposite azimuthal orientation perhaps; assume they lie in same plane, giving opening angle derived from vector dot product)\n\nIf we set azimuthal angle φ difference = π (they are opposite sides transversely?), actually in rest frame they are back-to-back meaning their momenta vectors are antiparallel. Choose coordinate system where pion A lies in x-z plane with positive x component, pion B opposite (-x,-z). Under boost, x-components remain ±p* sinθ*. Thus they stay opposite in transverse direction. Therefore the angle between them in lab depends on both transverse and longitudinal differences.\n\nVector A: (p_T , 0 , p_zA)\nVector B: (-p_T , 0 , p_zB)\n\nDot product: A·B = -p_T^2 + p_zA p_zB.\n\nMagnitudes |A| = sqrt(p_T^2 + p_zA^2); similarly for B.\n\nCosΔ = (A·B)/(|A||B|). Want minimum Δ ⇒ maximize cosine.\n\nSet variable x = cosθ*. Write expressions.\n\nFirst compute constants: define a = γ_R, β = β_R, E* = m_ρ/2, p* known.\n\nDefine C = β E*.\n\nThen p_zA = a(p* x + C)\np_zB = a(-p* x + C)\n\np_T = p* sqrt(1-x^2).\n\nNow compute dot product:\n\nA·B = -(p*^2)(1-x^2) + a^2[(p* x + C)(-p* x + C)] = -p*^2(1-x^2)+ a^2[-p*^2 x^2 + C^2] = -p*^2 + p*^2 x^2 + a^2(-p*^2 x^2 + C^2).\n\nSimplify: = -p*^2 + x^2[p*^2 - a^2 p*^2] + a^2 C^2 = -p*^2 + x^2 p*^2 (1 - a^2) + a^2 C^2.\n\nNote a = γ_R >1, so (1-a^2) negative.\n\nMagnitude squares:\n\n|A|^2 = p_T^2 + p_zA^2 = p*^2(1-x^2) + a^2(p* x + C)^2.\n\nSimilarly |B|^2 = p*^2(1-x^2) + a^2(-p* x + C)^2.\n\nBecause symmetric, these are equal: Indeed expand: a^2(p* x +C)^2 = a^2(p*^2 x^2 +2 p*C x + C^2). Other becomes a^2(p*^2 x^2 -2 p*C x + C^2). Sum with common term p*^2(1-x^2) results same overall expression? Not exactly; but magnitude square differs only by linear term sign which disappears upon squaring? Actually magnitude squared uses addition, no cross terms with sign change vanish? Let's compute explicitly:\n\n|A|^2 = p*^2(1-x^2) + a^2(p*^2 x^2 +2 p* C x + C^2).\n|B|^2 = p*^2(1-x^2) + a^2(p*^2 x^2 -2 p* C x + C^2).\n\nThey are different unless x=0. However product |A||B| appears symmetrical.\n\nTo find maximum cosine, differentiate wrt x maybe numerically.\n\nPlug numbers: \n\nParameters:\np* = 358.3 MeV,\nE* = 384.5 MeV,\nβ = 0.988,\nγ = 6.504,\nC = β E* = 0.988*384.5 = 379.6 MeV.\n\nAlso a = γ =6.504.\n\nCompute a^2 = 42.33.\n\nNow evaluate functions.\n\nWe'll try few values of x (cosθ*) ranging -1..1.\n\nGoal minimize opening angle Δ between the two lab pions. Likely occurs near forward/backward alignment making them close together after strong boost, possibly when θ* is such that the backward-moving pion gets boosted enough to also move forward, reducing angular spread.\n\nWhen θ* = 0 (first pion forward, second backward). Then x=1 for forward pion, but for pair we need opposite directions: one at θ*=0, other at π (x=-1). That's our scenario above with x representing cosθ* for forward pion? Our parameterization used one pion at angle θ* (with cosθ* = x) and the other at π-θ* (so its cos = -x). That covers general case. When θ* =0, x=1, then second pion angle π, cos = -1. Plug x=1.\n\nCompute quantities:\n\np_T = p* sqrt(1-1)=0. So both pions purely longitudinal. Then A·B = -0 + a^2*(-p*^2*1 + C^2)?? Wait plug x=1 into previous simplified expression: A·B = -p*^2 + x^2 p*^2 (1 - a^2) + a^2 C^2 = -p*^2 + p*^2 (1 - a^2) + a^2 C^2 = -p*^2 a^2 + a^2 C^2 = a^2(C^2 - p*^2).\n\nNumerical: C^2 = (379.6)^2 =144,110; p*^2=(358.3)^2=128,376. Difference =15,734. Times a^2=42.33 => 667k MeV^2.\n\nMagnitudes: |A| = |p_zA| since p_T=0. p_zA = a(p* + C) =6.504*(358.3+379.6)=6.504*737.9=4798 MeV.\n\n|B| = |p_zB| = a(-p* + C) =6.504*( -358.3+379.6)=6.504*21.3=138.6 MeV.\n\nProduct |A||B| = 4798*138.6=665,000 MeV^2 similar to dot product 667k leading cos≈1.003>1 due to approximations; physically should be <1. Means angle very tiny.\n\nOpening angle Δ = arccos(dot/(product)). With nearly parallel vectors, Δ small.\n\nCompute more accurate: Dot = a^2(C^2 - p*^2) = 42.33*15734= 666,900.\n\nProduct = a(p*+C) * a(C-p*) = a^2 [(C+p*)(C-p*)]= a^2 (C^2 - p*^2) same! So dot = product exactly, implying cos=1, Δ=0. Indeed for perfect collinearity when one particle moves exactly forward and the other backward in rest frame, after boost both move forward but with different speeds, yet they share same direction (the boost direction). This suggests opening angle zero—minimum angle is zero. However physical constraint: the backward pion might still travel backwards in lab if insufficient boost. Here boost is huge, so it ends up forward. Hence min opening angle is zero (they are colinear). But question probably expects non-zero due to finite transverse momentum? Maybe they ask \"minimum opening angle\" considering any allowed kinematics; indeed you can get arbitrarily small angle approaching zero when one pion emitted opposite to boost direction. So answer: essentially 0 degrees.\n\nHowever maybe they'd like calculation showing that the smallest angle occurs when one pion emitted opposite to boost direction resulting in angle ∆θ_min = arctan( p_T / p_z ), with p_T maximal when θ* =90°, produce larger angle. Minimum would be when θ* =0 or π giving zero opening angle.

Use relativistic inverse Compton formula.\n\nIn lab frame where electron has initial momentum p_e, gamma factor γ = E_total / m_ec^2 = (K + m c^2)/m c^2. Electron rest mass ~0.511 MeV. K=1000 MeV => total E ≈ 1000.511 MeV → γ≈ 1000.511/0.511 ≈ 1958? Let's calculate precisely: 1000 MeV /0.511 MeV = 1956.96; plus small extra from rest gives about 1957. So γ~1957.\n\nElectron velocity β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2γ²)= approx 1 - 1/(2*3.83E6)=1 -1.31e-7 so β≈0.99999987.\n\nPhoton incident opposite direction to electron motion (head on), i.e., photon traveling towards electron. Inverse Compton scattering angle θ' measured in electron rest frame maybe easier. We can transform photon into electron rest frame, scatter backward (θ'=π?), then transform back.\n\nGeneral formula for scattered photon energy in lab:\n\nε_s = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 \\gamma (1+β)}{1 + (\\epsilon_0/mc^2)\\gamma (1+β)(1-\\cos\\Theta)}\n\nwhere ε0 is incoming photon energy in lab, Θ is scattering angle in lab relative to original photon direction? Need correct expression.\n\nBetter use invariant s = (p_e + k)^2 etc. For head-on collision, maximum energy occurs for backscattering (photon emitted forward along electron direction after scattering). That's what they ask: θ=180° meaning scattering angle between incident photon direction and outgoing photon direction is 180°, which corresponds to photon being reflected backwards relative to its original direction—i.e., goes same direction as electron initially (since they were opposite).\n\nThus we want highest possible photon energy (inverse Compton peak): \n\nE'_max = \\frac{4 γ^2 ε}{1 + 4 γ ε / (mc^2)}   (for Thomson regime approximations?). Actually standard result for head‑on collisions producing forward scattered photon (in lab) is:\n\nE_{γ}^{max}= \\frac{E_i\\, (1+\\beta)}{1 - \\beta \\cos\\theta'} ??? Not sure.\n\nLet's derive using Lorentz transformation.\n\nLet Lab frame L: electron moves +x with speed v (βc); photon comes from -x direction (opposite). Photon four-momentum: k = (ε/c , -ε/c * n̂ ) where n̂ points +x? Wait photon propagates toward electron, so its momentum vector is opposite electron's velocity. Choose x axis positive direction of electron velocity. Then photon travels negative x direction, so its spatial component is (-ε/c,0,0). Good.\n\nTransform to electron rest frame S': boost with velocity -v (so that electron becomes stationary). The Lorentz transformation for photon energy:\n\nε' = γ ε (1 + β cos α)\n\nWhere α is angle between photon's propagation direction and electron velocity in lab. Since photon coming opposite, cosα = -1. Thus ε' = γ ε (1 - β). Because 1+β(-1)? Wait formula: Energy transforms as ε' = γ ε (1 - β cosθ_lab)?? Let's recall: frequency ν' = γ ν (1 - β cosθ) where θ is angle between photon direction and boost direction (+x). If photon moving opposite (+x?) Actually boost direction is +x (electron velocity). Cosθ = μ = direction cosine of photon w.r.t +x. Here photon direction is -x, thus μ=-1. So ν' = γ ν (1 - β*(-1)) = γ ν (1 + β). Hmm sign confusion. Let's verify via invariance: Doppler shift: observed frequency f' = f γ (1 - β cosθ) where observer moving with velocity βc relative to source. If observer moves towards source (source ahead), you get blueshift. Our electron sees approaching photon head-on -> should see higher energy than lab because it's moving towards it. Therefore factor should be (1+β). Indeed since cosθ = π (or -1), 1 - β(-1) = 1+β >1. So ε' = γ ε (1+β). Good.\n\nSo in electron rest frame, photon energy boosted: ε' = γ ε (1+β). Plug numbers: ε = 2 eV = 2×10^{-19} J but keep eV units. Convert mc^2 = 511 keV = 5.11e5 eV. Compute γ≈1957, β≈√(1-1/γ²)≈0.999999869. Approx 1+β≈1.9999999 ≈2. So ε' ≈ γ * ε * 2 ≈ 1957*2*2 eV = 7828 eV ≈ 7.8 keV. More precise: 1957*2*(1+β) ; (1+β)≈1+0.99999987=1.99999987. Multiply: 1957*2*1.99999987 ≈ 1957*3.99999974 ≈ 7828 eV indeed.\n\nNow in electron rest frame, photon scatters off stationary electron. Backscatter means photon emerges opposite its incoming direction? But we care about lab backscatter (θ=180°). In electron rest frame, the maximal energy of scattered photon occurs when it is scattered directly forward (same direction as incoming photon) or backward? Let's think: After transforming back, the condition for lab photon going forward (along +x) corresponds to scattering angle θ' = 0 (forward) in electron rest frame? Usually for inverse Compton, max photon energy achieved when photon is scattered forward in electron rest frame (i.e., along electron motion direction). That yields largest boost back to lab.\n\nOur incoming photon in ERF is moving towards +x? In ERF, due to boost, its direction changes slightly: originally -x, after boost, still roughly -x but aberration may change angle. However for ultra-relativistic case, it's nearly head-on also. We'll assume scattering angle ψ' (angle between incoming and outgoing photon directions in ERF). To maximize lab photon energy, set ψ' = π (backward scattering in ERF) leading to forward emission in lab? I recall formula: E_max = \\frac{4 γ^2 ε}{1+4γ ε / (mc^2)} . This arises assuming head-on and scattering angle zero degrees in lab (photon continues in electron direction). Derivation uses Compton formula in ERF with scattering angle θ'* = π (i.e., photon reversed). Yes that's typical.\n\nThus we take ERF scattering angle θ*_s = π (photon reverses direction). Using Compton formula in ERF:\n\nEnergy after scattering in ERF:\nε'' = \\frac{ε'}{1 + (ε'/ (m c^2))(1 - cos χ)}\nwhere χ is scattering angle in ERF between incoming and outgoing photon directions. For reversal, χ = π ⇒ 1 - cosχ = 1 - (-1) = 2.\n\nHence denominator: 1 + (2 ε')/(m c^2).\n\nPlug values: ε' ≈ 7.828 keV = 7.828 ×10³ eV. Divide by mc^2 = 511 keV = 5.11×10⁵ eV. Ratio r = ε'/ (mc^2) = 7.828e3 / 5.11e5 ≈ 0.01532. Twice that: 0.03064. Denominator = 1 + 0.03064 = 1.03064.\n\nTherefore ε'' ≈ ε' / 1.03064 ≈ 7.828keV /1.03064 ≈ 7.595 keV.\n\nNow transform this scattered photon back to lab frame. Its direction now will be approximately +x (because reversed). Transform energy:\n\nLab energy ε_f = γ ε'' (1 + β cos θ'')\nwhere θ'' is angle of photon in ERF relative to +x direction (boost direction). After reverse scattering, photon now moves roughly +x direction (same as electron velocity). Hence cosθ'' ≈ +1. So factor (1 + β). Again approximate 2γ ε''. So ε_f ≈ γ ε'' (1 + β) ≈ 2γ ε''. With γ≈1957, multiply: 2*1957*7.595 keV = 3914 *7.595 keV ≈ 29730 keV = 29.73 MeV.\n\nBut there is more exact formula giving:\n\nE_max = \\frac{4 γ^2 ε}{1 + 4 γ ε /(m c^2)} .\n\nLet's evaluate using that simpler form. Compute numerator: 4 γ^2 ε. γ^2 ≈ (1957)^2 ≈ 3.830e6. Times 4 gives 1.532e7. Multiply by ε=2 eV gives 3.064e7 eV = 30.64 MeV. Denominator: 1 + 4 γ ε /(m c^2). Compute term: 4 γ ε /(m c^2) = 4*1957*2 eV /511000 eV = (15656 eV)/(511000 eV) ≈ 0.03066. Add 1 => 1.03066. Now divide: 30.64 MeV /1.03066 = 29.75 MeV.

Starting from vacuum, you want to create isotopes; which heaviest possible given mass constraints? Options D= deuterium (^2H), ^3He, ^3T (tritium). Need masses:\n\nMasses:\n- Deuteron (^2H): about 1875.6 MeV/c² (proton+neutron minus binding ~2.224 MeV). Actually atomic mass approx 2.014102 u = 1877.84 MeV? Let's compute precisely: 1 u = 931.494 MeV. So 2.014102 * 931.494 ≈ 1878.0 MeV. But nuclear mass less electron etc. For simplicity use nucleon masses: proton 938.272 MeV, neutron 939.565 MeV => sum 1877.837 MeV. Binding reduces by 2.225 MeV -> nucleus mass ~1875.612 MeV. Add electrons? Isotope includes electrons if neutral atom. The problem likely uses atomic masses including electrons because they talk about isotopes produced from nothing maybe as atoms. However difference small relative to GeV.\n\n- Helium-3 (^3He): two protons + one neutron bound with BE≈7.718 MeV. Sum masses: 2*938.272 + 939.565 = 2816.109 MeV - 7.718 = 2808.391 MeV. Plus 2 electrons (since He has Z=2) each 0.511 MeV gives total atomic mass ~2809.413 MeV.\n\n- Tritium (^3H or T): one proton + two neutrons, BE≈8.482 MeV. Sum masses: 938.272 + 2*939.565 = 2817.402 MeV - 8.482 = 2808.920 MeV. plus one electron (0.511) → 2809.431 MeV.\n\nThus both helium-3 and tritium around 2.81 GeV. Both below 4.5 GeV, so could make them. Could also possibly make heavier like alpha particle (^4He) mass ~3727 MeV > 4.5? Wait α mass ~4.002603 u = 3730 MeV roughly. That's still <4.5 GeV! Indeed 4.5 GeV > 3.73 GeV, so could even make helium-4. But not listed among options. Maybe they consider only those three isotopes due to charge neutrality requirement? Or perhaps they ignore electrons and just count nuclei; then ^4He nucleus mass ~3727 MeV (<4500 MeV). Still would fit but not option.\n\nMaybe there is constraint on number of nucleons created per reaction? Not sure.\n\nGiven choices, the most massive among these is either ^3He or ^3T—they're similar mass (~2.809 GeV). Which is slightly larger? Compare atomic masses: ^3He atomic mass 3.016029 u vs ^3H atomic mass 3.015500 u. In atomic mass units, ^3He is slightly heavier (by about 0.000529 u = 0.492 keV?). Actually check: ^3He mass = 3.01602932265 u ; ^3H mass = 3.0160492777 u? Let’s verify: I recall tritium atomic weight ~3.01604928 u, while helium-3 is 3.01602932 u. So tritium is actually slightly heavier than helium-3 by about 20 micro-u i.e., ~19 keV. Hmm let's confirm: According to data, atomic mass of tritium (³H) = 3.016049278 u, helium-3 = 3.016029321 u. Yes tritium heavier by ~0.000019957 u = 18.6 keV. So tritium is more massive.\n\nTherefore the most massive among given is ^3T (tritium).\n\nBut ensure within 4.5 GeV: yes it's far lower.\n\nHence answer c.\n\nProvide reasoning steps.\n\nNow craft final answer with box.\n\nassistantfinalThe available rest‑energy \\(E_{\\rm avail}=4.5\\;\\text{GeV}\\) can be converted into mass according to  \n\n\\[\nm_{\\max }=\\frac{E_{\\rm avail}}{c^{2}}\\approx 4.5\\ {\\rm GeV}/c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nLet us compare this limit with the rest masses of the candidate isotopes (including their electrons, since “isotopes’’ refer to neutral atoms).\n\n| Isotope | Composition | Nuclear binding \\(B\\) (MeV) | Mass of constituents (MeV/\\(c^{2}\\)) | Atomic mass (MeV/\\(c^{2}\\)) |\n|---------|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| \\(^2\\mathrm H\\) (deuterium) | p+n | 2.22 | \\(938.27+939.57=1877.84\\) | \\(1875.61+1\\times0.511\\simeq 1876.12\\) |\n| \\(^3\\mathrm {He}\\) | 2p+n | 7.72 | \\(2·938.27+939.57=2816.11\\) | \\(2816.11-7.72+2×0.511\\simeq 2809.41\\) |\n| \\(^3\\mathrm T\\) (tritium) | p+2n | 8.48 | \\(938.27+2·939.57=2817.40\\) | \\(2817.40-8.48+1×0.511\\simeq 2809.43\\) |\n\nAll three masses are well below the 4.5 GeV budget (\\(\\sim 4500\\) MeV).  \nAmong them, the heaviest is **tritium** (\\(^3\\mathrm T\\)), whose atomic mass is approximately  \n\n\\[\nM_{\\,^3\\mathrm T}\\simeq 2.809\\;\\text{GeV}/c^{2},\n\\]\n\nslightly greater than that of \\(^3\\mathrm{He}\\) (about \\(2.809\\;\\text{GeV}/c^{2}\\) as well, but ∼20 keV lighter).\n\nSince no other offered isotope exceeds this value, the most massive isotope producible with 4.5 GeV of free energy is \\({}^{3}\\!\\mathrm T\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\text{(c)}\\; {}^{3}\\mathrm T}\n\\]"}

So number of nuclei per cm^3 = (ρ/ A )* N_A (since A g per mole). Each nucleus contains A nucleons, so nucleon number density = (ρ/ A)*N_A*A = ρ*N_A. Interesting! Because total nucleons per gram equals N_A (Avogadro's number), independent of A. Indeed because 1 gram contains N_A nucleons regardless of element composition.

Spin = ½ (fermion).\n\nPart (b): Conserved quantities: lepton number per family (flavor), total electric charge, energy-momentum, angular momentum, etc. In SM weak interactions conserve total lepton number L but individual flavor numbers can change via charged current only when accompanied by corresponding charged leptons; however in reactions like νμ+e−→ μ−+ν_e? Wait we need fill missing particle such that reaction conserves lepton numbers, charge, etc. Initial: ν_μ (lepton number L_mu=1), electron (L_e=-1?) Actually electrons carry lepton number Le=1 (for e-) ; positron would be -1. So initial total lepton numbers: L_mu=1, L_e=1 => total L=2. Final: mu- carries L_mu=1, unknown should carry L_e=1 to balance. That suggests it's an electron-type anti-neutrino? Let's see charges: left side net charge: νμ neutral, e- (-1) → total -1. Right side mu- also -1 plus unknown must be neutral. So unknown is likely ν̅_e (electron antineutrino) which has lepton number L_e = -1? Wait convention: lepton number assigned as +1 for particles (neutrino, charged lepton); antiparticles get -1. Electron has L_e=+1, so e- contributes +1. Neutrino µ gives L_µ=+1. Total L = +2. On RHS mu- gives L_µ=+1, unknown must give L_e=+1 -> that's an electron neutrino ν_e not antineutrino. But check charge: ν_e neutral, okay. Reaction: ν_μ + e⁻ → μ⁻ + ν_e . This respects lepton flavour: one muon type changes from neutrino to mu-, one electron type appears as ν_e. That's allowed via W exchange? Indeed process called inverse muon decay: ν_μ + e⁻ → μ⁻ + ν_e . Yes correct. So missing particle is ν_e.\n\nDifference between neutrino and antineutrino: opposite helicity/chirality for massless case; they carry opposite lepton number; interact differently under weak interaction (left-handed vs right-handed currents). For massive neutrinos both chiralities present but still distinct quantum states.\n\nPart (c): If m=0, Dirac neutrino's magnetic dipole moment proportional to mass, thus vanishes. Majorana cannot have diagonal magnetic moment either. Therefore no intrinsic magnetic moment. Spin orientation: For massless neutrino, helicity equals chirality. Weak interaction couples only to left‑handed chirality fields ⇒ neutrinos are left‑handed (spin antiparallel to momentum). Antineutrinos are right‑handed (spin parallel to momentum). Thus spin points opposite to motion for neutrino, same direction for antineutrino.\n\nPart (d): Need speed v given temperature T=3K corresponds to thermal kinetic energy ~ k_B T ≈ 8.617×10^{-5} eV/K *3≈2.585×10^{-4} eV. Assuming relativistic distribution, average momentum p~3kT/c? More precisely for nonrelativistic Maxwell-Boltzmann, mean kinetic energy = (3/2)kT. Use E_k = (γ-1)m c^2 ≈ (p^2)/(2m) for small velocities. Compute p using relation p = sqrt(2 m kT *3/2)? Actually <E> = (3/2)kT = p^2/(2m) => p = sqrt(3 m kT). Then γ ≈ 1 + (p^2)/(2 m^2 c^2)=1+(3 kT)/(2 mc^2). Plug values: kT = 2.6e-4 eV, m=0.1 eV, c^2 factor cancels units: ratio = (3*2.6e-4)/(2*0.1) = (7.8e-4)/(0.2)=3.9e-3. So gamma-1 ≈ 3.9e-3 => β = sqrt(1-(1/γ)^2) approx √(2(γ-1)) for small δ? Using γ≈1+δ where δ<<1 then β≈√(2δ). Here δ=3.9e-3, so β≈sqrt(7.8e-3)=0.088. So v≈0.09c ≈ 2.7 ×10^7 m/s.

I recall that Lamb shift separates them further but ignoring QED, Dirac equation gives degeneracy except small fine structure due to spin-orbit etc. Actually Dirac predicts exact energies depending only on j, not l; so 2P_1/2 and 2S_1/2 have same principal quantum number? Wait Dirac formula E_nj = -13.6eV / [n - δ(j,l)]^2 something like. But fine structure splits levels with different j within same n. For n=2, we have states: 2s_(1/2), 2p_(1/2), 2p_(3/2). In Dirac theory without radiative corrections, 2s_(1/2) and 2p_(1/2) are degenerate (same j=1/2). So spin-orbit alone would split 2p_(3/2)-2p_(1/2).\n\nWhat is value? Known experimental fine-structure interval between 2p_3/2 and 2p_1/2 is ~4.53×10^-5 eV? Let’s check memory: Fine structure of hydrogen's Balmer-alpha line (~656 nm) has components separated by about 0.365 cm⁻¹ maybe? Convert: 1 cm⁻¹ ≈ 1.23984e-4 eV. So 0.36 cm⁻¹ => 4.46e-5 eV. That matches earlier estimate.\n\nThus spin-orbit contribution likely part of this ~4.5e-5 eV. Among options given: 10^{-6}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-2}, 10^{0} eV. Which one closest? 10^{-4} eV equals 1e-4 eV, double our estimated 4.5e-5 eV, still nearest compared to 10^{-6}=1e-6 too low, 10^{-2}=0.01 eV far high, 1 eV huge. So answer should be 10^{-4} eV.\n\nBut perhaps they'd want approximate magnitude: spin-orbit splitting ∆E_so = ζ L·S where ζ~α^4 m c^2/n^3 * (some factor). Compute quickly:\n\nFor hydrogenic atom, spin-orbit Hamiltonian H_SO = (Z α)^4 mc^2/(2 n^3 ℓ(ℓ+1)) . times expectation of L·S giving ±½ ħ². For Z=1, n=2, ℓ=1 → denominator 2*8? Let's use known expression: ΔE_SO = (Zα)^4 mc^2 /(2 n^3) * [j(j+1)-ℓ(ℓ+1)-s(s+1)]/[ℓ(ℓ+1)]. With s=1/2. For j=3/2, numerator = (15/4)-(2)-(3/4)= (15/4-11/4)=1 ; divide by ℓ(ℓ+1)=2 -> 0.5. So ΔE = (Zα)^4 mc^2/(4 n^3). Plug numbers: α≈1/137, α^4≈ (1/137)^4 ≈ (7.30e-3)^4? Actually 1/137 ≈ 7.30e-3. Square: 5.33e-5. Fourth power: (5.33e-5)^2 ≈ 2.84e-9. Multiply by mc^2 =511 keV =5.11e5 eV. Then (Zα)^4 mc^2 ≈ 2.84e-9 *5.11e5 eV ≈ 1.45e-3 eV. Divide by (4 n^3): n=2→ n^3=8, multiply denominator 32. So result ≈ 1.45e-3 /32 ≈ 4.5e-5 eV. Good! That's indeed ~4.5 ×10^{-5} eV, i.e., close to 10^{-4}. So answer: 10^{-4} eV.\n\nProvide reasoning then final box.\n\nassistantfinalThe spin‑orbit interaction for a hydrogenic electron can be written as  \n\n\\[\nH_{\\text {SO}}=\\frac{(Z\\alpha )^{4}\\,mc^{2}}{2\\,n^{3}}\\,\n   \\frac{\\mathbf{L}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathbf S}{\\ell(\\ell +1)} ,\n\\qquad \n\\Delta E_{\\rm SO}\n      =\\frac{(Z\\alpha )^{4}mc^{2}}{2n^{3}}\n        \\frac{j(j+1)-\\ell (\\ell +1)-s(s+1)}\n             {\\ell(\\ell +1)},\n\\]\n\nwith \\(Z=1,\\;\\alpha\\simeq 1/137,\\;m_ec^{2}=511\\;\\mathrm{keV}\\).\nFor the \\(2p\\;(n=2,\\;\\ell =1)\\) level the two possible values of the total angular momentum are  \n\\(j=1/2\\) and \\(j=3/2\\).

{"id": "atomic/2-1", "questions": "Discuss 4 independent arguments against electrons existing inside the nucleus.\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisThe user asks to discuss four independent arguments against electrons existing inside the nucleus.\n\nWe need to give detailed reasoning with multiple physical arguments why electrons cannot exist within nuclear volume (i.e., bound inside nucleus). The question likely refers to historical considerations before quantum mechanics? Or modern understanding that electron wavefunctions have negligible probability density inside nucleus due to Heisenberg uncertainty principle, Pauli exclusion, energy scales etc.\n\nFour independent arguments could include:\n\n1) Energy/uncertainty principle: Confinement of electron to ~10^-15 m would require momentum ∆p~ħ/Δx leading kinetic energy > MeV scale far larger than binding energies; thus not energetically favorable.\n\n2) Coulomb repulsion vs attraction: Electron is negatively charged; being inside positively-charged nucleus leads to huge potential energy but also strong screening? Actually net charge distribution yields different potentials; if electron were inside uniform sphere, potential is harmonic near center, giving high zero-point energy.\n\n3) Experimental evidence from scattering experiments: Deep inelastic scattering shows no lepton constituents inside nuclei beyond protons/neutrons; electron-nucleus cross sections consistent with pointlike nucleons.\n\nBut we want argument \"against electrons existing inside the nucleus\". Could mention beta decay where electron emitted originates outside nucleus because it's created via weak interaction, not pre-existing.\n\nAlso consider spin-statistics & Pauli principle: Nucleons already fill available states; adding electron into same region would violate Fermi statistics? Not directly.\n\nBetter list:\n\nA) Quantum mechanical confinement energy too high (Heisenberg).\n\nB) Nuclear forces dominate over electromagnetic at short distances; any electron placed there would experience extremely strong electric fields causing pair production or annihilation?\n\nC) Observational constraints: Muonic atoms show finite size effects; measured hyperfine splitting indicates electron's wavefunction largely outside nucleus; muon can orbit close but still mostly external.\n\nD) Beta-decay kinematics: Electrons appear as products, not initial components; neutrino emission ensures conservation laws without needing internal electrons.\n\nAlternatively use atomic spectroscopy: Lamb shift measurements sensitive to electron penetration; predictions match observations assuming no interior electrons.\n\nLet's craft thorough discussion each argument separate, referencing equations.\n\nWill present final answer box summarizing key points maybe bullet list.\n\nOk produce response.assistantfinalBelow are **four distinct, physically‑independent reasons** showing that ordinary “atomic’’ electrons cannot reside *inside* the volume occupied by a nucleus (\\(R_{\\!N}\\sim 1\\text{–}10\\,{\\rm fm}=10^{-15}{\\rm m}\\)).  \nEach argument uses a different branch of physics – quantum‐mechanics, relativistic field theory, experimental scattering data, and observed β‑decay phenomenology – so they do not rely on one another.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 1.   Heisenberg‑Uncertainty / Kinetic‑Energy Argument  \n\nIf an electron were confined to a region comparable to the nuclear radius \\(R_{N}\\), its position uncertainty would satisfy  \n\n\\[\n\\Delta x\\;\\lesssim\\; R_N .\n\\]\n\nFrom the Heisenberg relation  \n\n\\[\n\\Delta p \\gtrsim \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta x}\n          \\;\\approx\\;\n          \\frac{\\hbar}{R_N},\n\\]\n\nthe corresponding minimum kinetic energy (non‑relativistically)\n\n\\[\nK_{\\min }\\simeq \n      \\frac{(\\Delta p)^2}{2m_e}\n     =\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m_eR_N^{2}}\n\\]\n\nis enormous.

A state with such a high kinetic energy would be unbound; it would promptly escape the nucleus rather than remain trapped. Hence quantum‑mechanical confinement makes an intra‑nuclear electron impossible.\n\n*(Relativistically, using \\(E\\approx pc\\) instead of \\(p^{2}/2m\\) only raises the required energy further, to tens of MeV.)*\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 2.   Electrostatic Potential Inside a Uniformly Charged Sphere  \n\nTreat the nucleus as a uniformly positive charge distribution of total charge \\(+Ze\\) and radius \\(R_N\\). For a point located at distance \\(r<R_N\\) from the centre, Gauss’s law gives the electrostatic potential  \n\n\\[\nV(r)=\\frac{Ze}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0R_N}\n        \\Bigl(3-\\frac{r^{2}}{R_N^{2}}\\Bigr)\n    = V_0 - \\tfrac12 kr^{2},\\qquad   \nk=\\frac{Ze}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0R_N^{3}},\n\\]\nwhich is a **harmonic oscillator** well centred at the origin.

The lowest allowed orbital lies many MeV above the continuum, so the electron cannot occupy a stationary bound level inside the nucleus. Instead it would be expelled (or, equivalently, never form such a state).\n\nThus the **shape of the Coulomb potential itself forbids low‑energy bound solutions** inside the nuclear volume.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 3.   Direct Experimental Evidence from Leptonic Scattering  \n\nHigh‑energy electron (and muon) deep‑inelastic scattering off nuclei provides a direct probe of the spatial distribution of charges down to sub‑fermi resolution. The differential cross section factorises schematically as  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{{\\rm d}\\sigma}{{\\rm d}\\Omega}\n   = \\underbrace{\n      \\left|\\int\\rho({\\bf r})\n            e^{ i{\\bf q}\\cdot{\\bf r}}d^{3}r\\right|^{2}}_{\\displaystyle\\text{form factor }F(q)}\n      \\times \\text{Mott term},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\rho({\\bf r})\\) is the target charge density. If a non‑negligible fraction of the negative charge resided **within** the nuclear radius, the elastic form factor would display a pronounced enhancement at very large momentum transfers (\\(|{\\bf q}|>200\\ {\\rm MeV/c}\\)), reflecting Fourier components of order \\(1/R_N\\).\n\nMeasurements performed at SLAC, JLab, CERN, and elsewhere up to \\(|{\\bf q}|\\sim 1\\ {\\rm GeV/c}\\) reveal **no extra strength** beyond what is accounted for solely by the proton and neutron distributions. The extracted charge densities agree with a picture in which all negative elementary leptons are *outside* the nuclear matter, while the interior contains only the positively‑charged quarks bound by QCD. \n\nConsequently, **empirical scattering data exclude any appreciable population of electrons inside the nucleus**, providing an observational counter‑argument completely independent of theoretical estimates.\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 4.   β‑Decay Phenomenology Shows Electrons Are Created Outside the Nucleus  \n\nIn nuclear β⁻ decay a neutron transforms into a proton, emitting simultaneously an electron and an antineutrino through the weak interaction:\n\n\\[\nn \\rightarrow p + e^{-}+ \\overline\\nu _e .\n\\]\n\nTwo facts derived from precise spectra and angular correlations demonstrate that the electron does **not** pre‑exist inside the parent nucleus:\n\n1. **Continuous Energy Spectrum:** The electron kinetic energy ranges continuously from 0 up to the endpoint set by the mass difference between initial and final nuclei. If the electron had been bound beforehand, its removal would cost a fixed binding energy (∼keVs) and the spectrum would exhibit discrete lines—contrary to observation.\n\n2. **Angular Correlation Measurements:** Experiments measuring the correlation between the emitted electron direction and the recoil nucleus (or accompanying neutrino) find results fully compatible with a three‑body decay occurring at a single space‑time point *inside* the nucleus, followed by immediate free propagation of the electron. No signature of an initially localized electron cloud is seen.\n\nMoreover, when a μ⁻ replaces the electron (μ capture), the captured muon indeed occupies an inner atomic orbit whose Bohr radius is ≈207 times smaller than that of the electron, yet even the muon’s wave function has only a tiny overlap (\\(<10^{-5}\\)) with the nuclear volume. This empirical fact underscores how strongly the electroweak process creates the lepton **after** the transition, not by liberating a pre‑existing particle residing inside the nucleus.\n\nHence, the **observed properties of β‑decay** constitute a fourth, experimentally grounded argument that ordinary electrons are absent from the nuclear interior.\n\n---\n\n\n\n### Summary  \n\nAll four arguments converge on the same conclusion:\n\n| # | Core Idea | Why It Excludes Intrinsic Electrons |\n|---|-----------|-------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Uncertainty principle → gigantic kinetic energy for confinement |\\(~\\!{\\rm MeV}\\)–\\(10\\ {\\rm MeV}\\) >> binding ⇒ unbound |\n| 2 | Harmonic Coulomb potential inside a uniformly charged sphere → eigenvalues \\(\\gg\\) MeV | No low‑lying bound levels exist |\n| 3 | High‑\\(Q^{2}\\) lepton scattering → measured charge form factors lack any intra‑nuclear lepton component | Data rule out hidden electrons |\n| 4 | β‑decay spectra & angular correlations → electrons are produced during the weak transition, not pre‑existent | Decays behave as three‑particle creation, not liberation |\n\nTaken together, these independent pieces of reasoning—from fundamental quantum limits, classical electromagnetism, precision experiment, and weak‑interaction phenomenology—provide a robust, multi‑faceted proof that **electrons do not live inside atomic nuclei**.   \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Ordinary electrons cannot exist within the nuclear volume.}}\n\\]"}

For perfectly rigid sphere, after collision velocity magnitude unchanged but direction changes according to geometry: angle θ between incoming and outgoing directions related to impact parameter via sin(θ/2)=b/R . Actually for central potential zero outside sphere, inside it's impenetrable so trajectory reflects as if mirror plane tangent at contact point. The deflection angle χ=π - 2α where α is incidence angle relative to normal. Geometry gives relation: b = R cos α ; scattering angle Θ = π - 2α => α = (π-Θ)/2. Then b = R cos[(π-Θ)/2] = R sin(Θ/2). Wait check sign: cos((π-Θ)/2)=sin(Θ/2). So b = R sin(Θ/2).\n\nDifferential cross-section defined classically: dσ = 2π b db corresponds to ring of impact parameters giving angles between Θ and Θ+dΘ.

Binding energies given. Also Yttrium with Z=39, N=51 also mass number 90. They have different ground-state masses due to Coulomb etc. Isospin T? For nucleus with N-Z difference, total isospin projection T_z = (N - Z)/2 = (50-40)/2 = 10/2 =5. So ground state has minimal isospin T_min = |T_z| =5. Excited states can have higher isospin values like T=6,7,... up to maybe A/2.\n\nQuestion asks estimate excitation energy of lowest T=6 isospin state in ^90Zr. Use concept of isobaric analog states (IAS). The IAS of the ground state of neighboring odd-A or even-even nuclei appears as excited state in other member of multiplet. Here we have two members of same isobars: ^90Zr (Z=40,N=50,Tz=+5) and ^90Y (Z=39,N=51,Tz=+6?). Wait compute Tz for Y: N=51,Z=39 => N-Z=12 -> Tz=6. Indeed its ground state likely has T=Tz=6 because it's odd-odd? Actually Y-90 is odd-proton odd-neutron? But anyway.\n\nThus the ground state of ^90Y corresponds to T=6 state (lowest possible) with Tz=+6. This should be isobaric analogue of the T=6 state in ^90Zr but shifted by Coulomb differences. Therefore excitation energy E* ≈ [B.E.(^90Zr) - B.E.(^90Y)] + ΔC where sign careful.\n\nBinding energy defined positive numbers meaning more bound means lower mass. Mass M = Z m_p + N m_n - BE/c^2 . Lower BE → larger mass. To get excitation energy of T=6 state in Zr relative to its ground state (T=5), consider that the T=6 state would correspond energetically to moving one proton into neutron direction? Equivalent to taking the ground state of Y (which has extra proton turned into neutron?) Let's think:\n\nIsobaric analog state: Energy difference between IASs equals Coulomb displacement energy plus small charge-independence breaking terms. Approximate using experimental binding energies: The excitation energy of T=6 state in Zr = [M(^90Y) - M(^90Zr_g.s.)]c^2 - ΔE_C?? Hmm.\n\nBetter approach: Since both nuclei have same A, their mass excess differ mainly due to Coulomb term. If you take the ground state of Y which has T=6, then the corresponding T=6 state in Zr will have similar nuclear part (same strong interaction) but less Coulomb repulsion because it has one additional proton compared to Y? Actually Zr has Z=40 vs Y Z=39, so Zr has one more proton thus greater Coulomb energy, making it heavier (less bound) than Y after correcting for nuclear symmetry energy?\n\nBut they gave binding energies: BE(Zr)=783.916 MeV, BE(Y)=782.410 MeV. Thus Zr is more tightly bound by about 1.506 MeV despite having extra proton. That suggests net effect of adding a proton (and removing a neutron) increased binding overall (due to pairing/shell effects). However the Coulomb penalty reduces binding, but still net increase.\n\nNow the T=6 state in Zr would have same composition as Y's ground state except protons/neutrons swapped? In IAS picture, the wavefunction differs only by exchanging a neutron with a proton while keeping spatial configuration unchanged. Hence the nuclear contribution to binding energy (strong force) is identical across the multiplet; only Coulomb changes cause shift.\n\nTherefore excitation energy of T=6 state in Zr relative to its ground state (T=5) approximates the difference in Coulomb energies between configurations differing by converting a neutron to a proton within the same orbital set. That's essentially the difference in binding energies between the two nuclei minus any change from pairing etc not accounted.\n\nSimplify: Assume the T=6 state's binding energy equal to that of Y's ground state corrected for Coulomb difference between Z=40 and Z=39. Then excitation energy E_x = BE(T=6 in Zr) - BE(g.s., Zr). Since BE(T=6 in Zr) ~ BE(Y_ground) + ΔCoulomb(ΔZ=+1). Because going from Y (Z=39) to Zr (Z=40) adds a proton, increasing Coulomb repulsion, reducing binding by some amount δC >0. So BE_T6_Zr = BE_Y - δC. We don't know δC directly, but could approximate via semi-empirical formula: Coulomb term proportional to Z(Z-1)/A^(1/3). Difference approx ∂E_c/∂Z *1.\n\nCompute Coulomb energy EC≈a_c Z(Z-1)/A^{1/3}. Using typical a_c~0.714 MeV. Compute A=90, A^{1/3}=90^{1/3}=~4.48. Z=39 gives EC_39=a_c*39*38 /4.48. 39*38=1482. Multiply by 0.714 =>1058.9 MeV divided by 4.48 =>236.5 MeV. For Z=40: 40*39=1560 ; times 0.714=>1115. , divide 4.48 =>249.0 MeV. Increase ΔEC≈12.5 MeV. So adding a proton increases Coulomb repulsion by ~12.5 MeV, decreasing binding by same magnitude.\n\nThus BE_T6_Zr ≈ BE_Y - 12.5 MeV = 782.41 -12.5 = 769.91 MeV. Compare to ground state BE_Zr=783.92 MeV. So excitation energy = 783.92 - 769.91 =14.01 MeV. Roughly 14 MeV.\n\nAlternatively perhaps use simple relation: Excitation energy ≈ [BE(Zr)-BE(Y)] + ΔEc? Wait earlier we derived BE_T6_Zr = BE_Y - ΔEc. So E_exc = BE_Zr - (BE_Y - ΔEc) = (BE_Zr-BE_Y)+ΔEc = 1.506 +12.5 =14.0 MeV consistent.\n\nSo answer around 14 MeV.\n\nCould refine using actual measured Coulomb displacement energy known for this pair maybe ~13.5 MeV leading to ~15 MeV. We'll give estimated value ~14 MeV.\n\nProvide final box.\n\nassistantfinalFor the \\(A=90\\) isobars the third component of isospin  \n\n\\[\nT_{z}= \\frac{N-Z}{2}\n\\]\n\ngives  \n\n\\[\nT_{z}(^{90}{\\rm Zr})=\\frac{50-40}{2}=5,\\qquad \nT_{z}(^{90}{\\rm Y })=\\frac{51-39}{2}=6 .\n\\]\n\nHence the ground state of \\(^{90}{\\rm Y}\\) carries the minimum allowed isospin  \n\\(T_{\\min }=|T_{z}|=6\\); it is the **isobaric‑analogue** (IA) of the first\nexcited \\(T=6\\) state in \\(^{90}{\\rm Zr}\\).\n\nBecause all members of an isomultiplet share the same strong–interaction\nenergy, the energy difference between these two levels comes almost entirely\nfrom the change in Coulomb energy when a neutron is replaced by a proton,\ni.e. when the atomic number is changed from \\(Z=39\\) to \\(Z=40\\).\n\n---\n\n### 1.

Actually known result: Onsager's rule for quantum oscillations: extremal cross-section area S satisfies S = 2π e B/ ħ * (n+γ), or something like that? Let's recall: In de Haas-van Alphen effect, Landau levels correspond to quantized cyclotron orbits in reciprocal space: The condition is\n\nS(E_F) = 2π e B / ħ (n + γ)\n\nwhere γ=1/2 for free electrons ignoring Berry phase etc., but can shift due to Berry phases.\n\nBut they ask \"quantized condition on magnetic flux\" first: Using Bohr-Sommerfeld with minimal coupling yields\n\n∮ (p - eA/c)·dr = (n+½) h\n\nSince p = m v (or ℏk?), but using Lorentz force dp/dt = -(e/c)v × B . However maybe use time derivative of canonical momentum?\n\nEquation of motion: dp/dt = (e/c) v×B ? Wait sign: Force on charge q=-e: F = q(v×B)/c => (-e)(v×B)/c = -e/c v×B. So dp/dt = -e/c v×B.\n\nNow consider line integral around closed path: ∮ p·dr = ∮ p·v dt = ∫ p·v dt over period T. But perhaps easier: differentiate the action integral w.r.t time leads to energy times period etc.\n\nAlternatively compute ∮ (p - eA/c)·dr = ∮ p·dr - (e/c)∮ A·dr.\n\nUsing Stokes theorem, second term equals (e/c)Φ_B where Φ_B = ∮ A·dl = ∫ B·dS (magnetic flux through loop).\n\nThus quantization gives ∮ p·dr - (e/c)Φ = (n+½)h.\n\nNow relate ∮ p·dr via dynamics: Since dp/dt = -e/c v×B, then p changes direction but magnitude constant if only magnetic field (no electric fields). Then p·dr integrated over one cycle might equal zero? Not exactly. We could write d(p·r)=p·dr+r·dp. Over closed loop average r·dp integrates to ... Might lead to relationship between kinetic part and flux.\n\nBetter approach: Write canonical momentum π = p - eA/c ; its circulation is quantized as above. But also note that mechanical angular momentum L_mech = r×p. Magnetic flux appears.\n\nIn uniform B, choose gauge such that A = (1/2) B×r (symmetric gauge). Then π = p - (e/2c) B×r. Its curl is related to orbital radius.\n\nFor circular orbit radius R perpendicular to B, the enclosed real-space area A_r = πR^2. Flux Φ = BA_r.\n\nQuantization becomes (e/c)BA_r = (n+½)h because ∮ p·dr vanishes for pure magnetic forces? Indeed for purely magnetic central force, work done zero so kinetic contribution cancels? I think indeed ∮ p·dr =0 because p is always orthogonal to dr? No, p parallel to velocity, dr same direction, dot product non-zero. But integrate over full circle gives net zero change in position? Hmm.\n\nLet's do more formal: Consider Hamiltonian H = (p-eA/c)^2/(2m). Energy E fixed. The classical trajectory lies on constant-energy surface. The action variable J = (1/2π)∮ p·dq = ?\n\nStandard derivation of Landau level degeneracy uses condition that number of states per unit area = eB/hc. That arises from flux quantization: each state occupies flux quantum hc/e.\n\nSo likely answer: Quantized flux condition: Φ = (n+½) φ_0 , where φ_0 = hc/e is flux quantum.\n\nHence magnetic flux through orbit = (n+½) (hc/e). That's the first part.\n\nSecond part: Express in k-space area S: Real-space orbit area A_r relates to k-space area via semiclassical equations: ℏ dk/dt = -e/c v×B -> drift in k-space? Actually for Bloch electrons under B, the orbit in k-space is given by constant energy contour intersect plane normal to B. The rate of change of k is proportional to B×v leading to area in k-space being linked to real-space area via: Δr_perpendicular = (ℏ c)/(e B) Δk_area ??? Known Onsager relation: S = (2π e B/ħ) (n+γ). Derive: From flux quantization: Φ = B·A_r = (n+½)φ_0. Also relation between A_r and S: A_r = (ħ c/e B) S . Because the guiding center displacement corresponds to area in k-space scaled by factor (ħ c/e B). Therefore substituting gives B*(ħ c/e B)*S = (ħ c/e ) S = (n+½) hc/e ⇒ S = 2π (n+½) (e B/ħ)? Check algebra:\n\nFlux quantum φ_0 = hc/e. Condition: B A_r = (n+½) hc/e .\n\nIf A_r = (ħ c/e B) S, then left side B*A_r = B* (ħ c/e B) S = (ħ c/e) S.\n\nSet equal: (ħ c/e) S = (n+½) hc/e → cancel c/e both sides: ħ S = (n+½) h → S = (n+½) (h/ħ) = (n+½) 2π . Wait that's not right dimensionally; missing B.\n\nActually correct relation is A_r = (ħ c/e B) S . Plugging into B A_r = (ħ c/e) S . Equate to (n+½) hc/e : (ħ c/e) S = (n+½) hc/e → divide both sides by (c/e): ħ S = (n+½) h → S = (n+½) (h/ħ) = (n+½) 2π . This would give no dependence on B, contradictory to known Onsager law. Something off: The scaling factor should involve 1/B squared? Let's rederive correctly.\n\nSemiclassical equations: ℏ dk/dt = - (e/c) v × B . With v = (1/ħ) ∂E/∂k . For motion confined to plane perpendicular to B, the orbit in k-space has frequency ω_c = eB/m*c? Anyway, the area swept in k-space during one period is related to real-space area via: A_r = (c/e B) ℏ S . Let’s check dimensions: [A_r] length², RHS: (c/e B) has units (velocity)*(charge^-1)*(magnetic field^-1) ~ (cm/s)/(esu * gauss) = cm³ s⁻¹ esu⁻¹ G⁻¹?? Not good.\n\nBetter known formula: Number of occupied states up to energy E in presence of B is N = (L_x L_y)/(2π l_B^2) where l_B = sqrt(ħ c/e B). Each Landau tube corresponds to area in k-space 2π/l_B^2 = 2π e B/ħ c . Thus S_n = 2π e B/ħ c (n+γ). Usually written without c in Gaussian units: S = 2π e B/ħ (n+γ). If using SI, replace c accordingly.\n\nTherefore final expression: S = 2π (e B/ħ) (n+½). That's the desired quantization condition.\n\nThus answer steps: Starting from BS quantization with minimal coupling, rewrite integral, use Stoke's theorem to isolate flux, argue kinetic term vanishes for periodic orbit in static B, giving flux quantization. Then connect real-space area to k-space area via semiclassical equations yielding Onsager relation.\n\nProvide final boxed answers:\n\nMagnetic flux quantization:\n\\[ \\Phi = \\int_S {\\bf B}\\!\\cdot d{\\bf S}= \\Bigl(n+\\frac12\\Bigr)\\,\\frac{hc}{e}. \\]\n\nCorresponding k‑space area quantization:\n\\[ S_{k}= \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar}\\Bigl(n+\\frac12\\Bigr).\\]\n\nWill include explanation.assistantfinalBelow is a complete step‑by‑step derivation.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### 1.

At 1 keV kinetic energy ~ speed sqrt(2E/m_p). Proton interacts via Coulomb with electron cloud; essentially screened potential. For such energies, de Broglie wavelength λ = h / p. Compute momentum p = sqrt(2 m E). m=938 MeV/c² ≈ 1.67e-27 kg. Energy 1keV =1000 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV =1.602e-16 J. So p = sqrt(2*1.67e-27*1.602e-16)=sqrt(5.35e-43)=7.32e-22 kg·m/s. Then λ =6.626e-34/7.32e-22≈9.05e-13 m =0.905 pm = about 0.009 Å. That's much smaller than atomic size (~0.5 Å). Therefore can treat as classical Rutherford-like but screening reduces forward scattering due to electronic shielding beyond some impact parameter comparable to Bohr radius a0~0.53 Å. The differential cross-section dσ/dΩ ∝ (Z_eff e^2/(8π ε0 E))^2 * 1/ sin⁴(θ/2), typical Rutherford, but effective charge is reduced because at distances >a0 net charge zero. Thus strong forward peak, falling sharply with angle, maybe isotropic component from close collisions leading to exchange etc. Expect most scattering at small angles, near-forward peaked distribution.\n\nPart b: Total cross-section approximated by geometric cross-section where projectile penetrates within atomic radius where unscreened nuclear charge felt.

In barns (1 barn =1e-28 m^2): σ≈8.8e-21 /1e-28 =8.8e7 barns = 88 million barns. But that seems huge; typical nuclear cross sections are few barns.

Actually 1 barn=10^-24 cm² so that's 400 barns.\n\nThey ask \"what upper and lower limits can you place on the elastic scattering cross section?\" Probably using total cross-section constraints like optical theorem or unitarity? For neutron-nucleus scattering, total cross-section σ_total = σ_elastic + σ_inelastic + ... maybe absorption etc. At low energies, there may also capture but not mentioned. So we might assume only two processes: elastic and inelastic. Then if we know that measured total cross-section cannot exceed some value based on geometric size? Upper limit could be from black-disk approximation: σ_max ≈ πR^2 where R≈r_0 A^{1/3}. Carbon atomic mass ~12 => radius approx r0~1.2 fm → R≈1.2*12^(1/3)=1.2*~2.289=2.75 fm. Area πR^2 ≈π*(2.75e-13 cm)^2 = π *7.56e-26 cm^2 = about 2.38e-25 cm^2 = 23.8 barns. That's far smaller than 400 barns! Something off. In nuclear physics cross sections often larger due to resonance. But typical total cross-sections for fast neutrons (~keV-MeV) with light nuclei are tens of barns. The given inelastic cross-section seems huge relative to geometry - perhaps they want simple inequality: Since total cross-section can't be negative, elastic >=0. Also since total cross-section ≤ something? Maybe use known total cross-section data for n-C at 1 keV? Could approximate total cross-section around few hundred barns? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively maybe they refer to sum rule: σ_tot = σ_el + σ_inel . Given only σ_inel known, then elastic can range from zero up to whatever maximum allowed by physical considerations such as unitarity bound: σ_el <= π/k^2 where k is wave number. Compute λ = h/p ; p = sqrt(2 m_n E). Use de Broglie wavelength. Let's compute:\n\nE = 1000 eV = 1 keV = 1.602e-16 J. Neutron mass m_n = 1.675e-27 kg. Momentum p = √(2mE) = sqrt(2*1.675e-27*1.602e-16) = sqrt(5.368e-43) = 7.33e-22 kg·m/s. Wave number k = p / ħ, ħ = 1.055e-34 Js -> k = 7.33e-22 / 1.055e-34 = 6.95e12 m⁻¹. Convert to cm⁻¹: multiply by 100 => 6.95e14 cm⁻¹. Unitarity limit for s-wave: σ_el,max = π/k^2 = π/(k^2). Compute k^2 = (6.95e12)^2 = 4.83e25 m⁻2 = convert to cm⁻2: multiply by (100)^2 = 1e4 => 4.83e29 cm⁻2. Wait careful: k in m⁻1 gave k^2 in m⁻2. To get per cm², note 1 m⁻2 = 10⁴ cm⁻2. So k^2 = 4.83e25 m⁻2 = 4.83e29 cm⁻2. Thus π/k^2 = 3.1416 / 4.83e29 = 6.50e-30 cm². That equals 6.5×10⁻30 cm² which is 6.5×10⁶ barns?? No because 1 barn = 1e-24 cm². This is much smaller: 6.5e-30 cm² = 6.5e-6 microbarns. Something wrong: The unit conversion yields extremely small area, meaning high momentum leads to tiny diffraction-limited cross-section. Indeed at higher energies, geometrical cross-section limited by λ^2 scale becomes very small. However actual nuclear cross sections remain order barns independent of λ due to strong interaction short-range potential. So the unitarity bound for each partial wave l gives max contribution (2l+1)*π/k^2. Summing many partial waves up to Lmax ~ ka where a is nuclear radius. Total geometric cross-section approximates πa^2. So better bound is σ_el ≤ πR^2 (black disk), same earlier estimate ~20 barns. So upper limit ~20 barns. Lower limit obviously ≥0.

For hydrogen-like atom with fine structure levels indicated j values. Determine allowed electric/magnetic multipole orders based on Δl, parity change etc.\n\nSelection rules:\n\nElectric multipole El:\nΔJ = J_f - J_i can be 0,..., l except not 0→0 for E0; also parity changes if l is odd? Actually electric multipole has parity (-1)^l . Magnetic multipole Ml has parity (-1)^{l+1}. So transition requires overall parity change consistent with operator.\n\nAtomic states have orbital angular momentum quantum number ℓ, total spin s=½, total j from coupling ℓ and s.\n\nTransitions between different n,l,j.\n\nFirst: 2p_1/2 → 1s_1/2 : initial ℓ=1, j=1/2 ; final ℓ'=0, j'=1/2. Change Δℓ = -1 => parity changes because p (odd) vs s(even): opposite parity. Electric dipole (E1) corresponds to Δℓ = ±1, parity change, Δj = 0,±1 but not 0↔0. Here Δj =0 so allowed. Dominant is E1.\n\nSecond: 2s_1/2 → 1s_1/2 : both ℓ=0, no parity change. Dipole forbidden. Next possible is magnetic dipole M1 or electric quadrupole E2? Need check selection rules: M1 does NOT change parity (parity factor (-1)^{l+1}, for l=1 gives negative? Wait M1 has parity (-1)^{1+1}=(-1)^2=+1, i.e., even, thus doesn't flip parity. Since initial and final parities equal, M1 could work provided Δℓ =0, Δj =0,±1 (but not 0↔0?). For M1, Δj =0,±1 but cannot be 0 ↔0? I think M1 allows 0↔0? Not sure. However 2s_1/2 (j=1/2) -> 1s_1/2 (j=1/2) Δj=0, okay. Also Δℓ=0 which matches M1 (since magnetic multipole involves vector spherical harmonic that couples ℓ unchanged). So leading order likely M1 (magnetic dipole).\n\nThird: 3d_3/2 → 2s_1/2 : ℓ=2 to ℓ=0, Δℓ=-2, parity: d (even) to s (even) same parity, so electric dipole (requires parity change) forbidden. Could be electric quadrupole E2: parity factor (-1)^2 = +1, no parity change, Δℓ = ±2 allowed. Yes E2 dominates. Check Δj: j_i=3/2, j_f=1/2, Δj=1 fits E2 rule (|Δj| ≤ L where L=l). For E2, L=2, |Δj|≤2 ok. So dominant E2.\n\nFourth: 2p_3/2 → 2p_1/2 : same ℓ=1, parity same, Δℓ=0. This is fine-structure splitting within same term. Allowed via M1 (or possibly E2 suppressed). The main would be magnetic dipole M1 since parity unchanged and Δℓ=0. So M1.\n\nFifth: 3d_3/2 → 2p_1/2 : ℓ=2 to ℓ=1, parity changes (even->odd) so electric dipole allowed (Δℓ=±1). Δj: 3/2 → 1/2, Δj=1, allowed for E1. Thus dominant E1.\n\nNow part b: Transition rate formula for electric dipole spontaneous emission: A_E1 ≈ (ω^3 |d|^2)/(3π ε₀ ħ c³). Approximate matrix element ~ e a (electron charge times Bohr radius). So A≈( ω^3 e² a² )/(3 π ε₀ ħ c³ ). Use α = e² / (4π ε₀ ħc). Then rewrite: A~ (4α ω^3 a²)/ (3 c²). Because e²/(ε₀)=4π α ħ c. Let's compute numeric: Typical optical transition energy ∼ few eV ⇒ ω∼ 2π * 5×10¹⁴ Hz (~visible). Take a≈ a₀ = 0.53 Å = 5.3e-11 m. Compute using python quickly.assistantanalysisLet's calculate approximate value.assistantanalysisWe'll do mental estimation: ω≈ 3×10^15 rad/s (corresponding to λ≈600 nm, f≈5×10^14 Hz, ω=2πf≈3×10^15). a≈5×10^-11 m. α≈1/137≈7.30e-3. Plug into A≈ (4 α ω^3 a²)/(3 c²). c≈3×10^8 m/s.\n\nCompute ω^3: (3×10^15)^3 =27 ×10^45 =2.7×10^46 rad^3/s^3.\n\na²=(5×10^-11)^2=25×10^-22=2.5×10^-21 m².\n\nMultiply ω^3 a²: 2.7×10^46 * 2.5×10^-21 =6.75×10^25.\n\nTimes 4α/3c²: First compute 4α/3 ≈ (4*7.3e-3)/3 ≈ (0.0292)/3 ≈9.73e-3.\n\nc²≈9×10^16. Divide by c² multiplies by 1/c²: multiply previous product by 9.73e-3 / 9e16 = approx 1.081e-18? let's compute: 9.73e-3 / 9e16 = 1.082e-19? wait: 9.73e-3 ÷ 9e16 = 1.08e-19. Multiply 6.75×10^25 * 1.08e-19 = 7.29×10^6 s^{-1}. So around 10^7 per second, corresponding lifetime ~100 ns. That's reasonable for allowed E1 transitions.\n\nThus we present expression and numeric estimate ~10^8 s^-1 maybe depending on exact numbers.\n\nPart c: Ratios.\n\nGeneral scaling: For electric dipole: A_E1 ∝ ω^3 a^2.\n\nFor magnetic dipole M1: amplitude similar magnitude but extra factor (v/c)^2 compared to E1 due to magnetic moment µ_B ~ eħ/2m_e. Matrix element scales like μ_B a ? Actually M1 transition rate: A_M1 ≈ (μ₀ ω^3 |M|^2)/(3π ħ c³ ), where M ~ (eħ/2m_e) a (maybe). Ratio M1/E1 roughly (k a)^2 (where k=ω/c) squared? Standard result: M1 slower than E1 by factor ~(α ω a /c?) hmm.\n\nBetter use known ratio: For comparable frequencies, M1 rate ~ (α^2)(ka)^2 times E1? Might derive: Electric dipole moment d~ea, magnetic dipole moment m~ (eħ/2m_e) ~ μ_B. Compare magnitudes: d ~ ea, m ~ (eħ/2m_e) = (e a_0 α)/2? Actually μ_B = eħ/2m_e = e a_0 α/2 (since a_0 = ħ/(m_ecα)). So m ~ e a_0 α/2. Therefore ratio |m|/|d| ~ α/2 (dimensionless). In rate formulas there is additional factor of (ω/c)^2 for magnetic versus electric? Indeed power radiated by magnetic dipole goes as (ω^4 |m|^2)/(12π ε₀ c^3) while electric dipole goes as (ω^4 |d|^2)/(12π ε₀ c^3)? Wait both scale similarly ω^4? But earlier we had ω^3 for spontaneous emission coefficient after dividing by ħ ω. Anyway ratio ~ (|m|/|d|)^2 (some factor). Roughly suppression by α^2 ~ 5×10^-5.\n\nSo M1 transitions are ~10^−5 weaker than E1.\n\nSimilarly electric quadrupole E2 rate scales as (ω^5 a^4)/(...); compare to E1: factor (ka)^2 where k=ω/c. Since ka <<1 (atomic size vs wavelength), typically ka~ (a/λ) ~ 10^-3. So E2 suppressed by (ka)^2 ~10^-6 relative to E1. Additional factor may include some constant.\n\nTherefore:\n\nTransition 2 (M1) rate ≈ α^2 * A_E1 ≈ (1/137)^2 ≈5×10^-5 times A_E1.\n\nTransition 3 (E2) rate ≈ (ka)^2 * A_E1 ≈ (ω a /c)^2 A_E1. Using ω a /c = (2π a/λ) ~ 2π*(0.05nm)/(500nm) ≈ 2π*1e-4 =6×10^-4. Square ~3.6×10^-7. So E2 ~10^-7 A_E1.\n\nBut note also difference in powers: E2 includes ω^5 a^4 vs ω^3 a^2 giving factor (ω a /c)^2 again.\n\nTransition 4 (M1) similar to #2, same order α^2.\n\nTransition 5 (E1) same as reference, perhaps slightly different ω (different energies). Rate proportional to ω^3. If its ω' differs, ratio = (ω'/ω)^3.\n\nProvide expressions.\n\nNow craft final answer with boxes.\n\nassistantfinal**(a)   Dominant electromagnetic‑multipole for each line**\n\nThe selection rules for single–photon decay are  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&{\\rm Parity}: && {\\cal P}_{i}{\\cal P}_{f}=(-1)^{L}\\quad({\\rm electric}) ,\n\\\\[-2mm]\n&&& {\\cal P}_{i}{\\cal P}_{f}=(-1)^{L+1}\\qquad ({\\rm magnetic}), \\\\[2mm]\n&\\Delta J &=&0,\\pm1,\\ldots ,\\pm L\\;(J_i=J_f=0\\hbox{ excluded for }E0),\n\\\\\n&\\Delta \\ell &=\n\\begin{cases}\n\\pm L      &(E\\,L)\\\\[1mm]\n0          &(M\\,L)\n\\end{cases}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nUsing these rules together with the spectroscopic notation  \n\\(n\\ell _{j}\\) (\\(\\ell=s,p,d,\\dots\\)), the lowest‑order multipole that satisfies all conditions is :\n\n| transition                              | \\(\\ell_i\\to\\ell_f\\) | parity change? | smallest \\(L\\) | dominant multipole |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|\n| \\(2p_{1/2}\\!\\to\\!1s_{1/2}\\)            | \\(1\\to0\\)           | yes           | \\(L=1\\)       | **E1** (electric dipole) |\n| \\(2s_{1/2}\\!\\to\\!1s_{1/2}\\)            | \\(0\\to0\\)           | no            | \\(L=1\\) (mag.)| **M1** (magnetic dipole) |\n| \\(3d_{3/2}\\!\\to\\!2s_{1/2}\\)            | \\(2\\to0\\)           | no            | \\(L=2\\)       | **E2** (electric quadrupole) |\n| \\(2p_{3/2}\\!\\to\\!2p_{1/2}\\)            | \\(1\\to1\\)           | no            | \\(L=1\\) (mag.)| **M1** (magnetic dipole) |\n| \\(3d_{3/2}\\!\\to\\!2p_{1/2}\\)            | \\(2\\to1\\)           | yes           | \\(L=1\\)       | **E1** (electric dipole) |\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### (b)   Order‑of‑magnitude rate for the “reference’’ line   \n\\(2p_{1/2}\\rightarrow 1s_{1/2}\\) – an electric‑dipole (E1) transition  \n\nFor an electric dipole the Einstein‑A coefficient is\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{E1}}\\;\\approx\\;\n\\frac{\\omega^{3}}{3\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}\\hbar c^{3}}\n\\big|\\langle f|\\,\\mathbf d\\,|i\\rangle\\big|^{2},\n\\qquad \n\\mathbf d=e\\mathbf r .\n\\]\n\nIn a hydrogenic atom the radial matrix element is of order the Bohr radius,\n\\(|\\langle f|r|i\\rangle |\\sim a\\equiv a_{0}\\).\nHence\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\nA_{\\text{E1}}\\;\\sim\\;\n\\frac{\\omega^{3}e^{2}a^{2}}{3\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}\\hbar c^{3}}\n     \\;=\\;\n\\frac{4\\alpha}{3}\\,\n\\frac{\\omega^{3}a^{2}}{c^{2}},\n}\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nwith \\(\\displaystyle\\alpha=\\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}\\hbar c}\\) the fine‑structure constant.\n\nTaking a typical visible transition,\n\\(\\lambda\\simeq 600\\;\\mathrm{nm}\\Rightarrow\\omega\\simeq 3\\times10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\),\nand \\(a=a_{0}=5.3\\times10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\),\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{E1}}\\;\\approx\\;\n\\frac{4}{3}\\,\\alpha\\,\n\\frac{(3\\times10^{15})^{3}(5.3\\times10^{-11})^{2}}{(3\\times10^{8})^{2}}\n\\;\\sim\\;10^{7}\\;{\\rm s^{-1}} .\n\\]\n\nThus the natural lifetime of an allowed E1 line is of order  \n\n\\[\n\\tau\\sim\\frac{1}{A_{\\text{E1}}}\\;\\approx\\;10^{-7}\\!-\\!10^{-8}\\ {\\rm s}.\n\\]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### (c)   Relative strengths of the remaining lines  \n\nAll rates can be expressed through the reference quantity (1).  \nOnly two further ingredients matter:\n\n* **Magnetic‑dipole (M1)** amplitudes contain the electronic magnetic moment  \n  \\(\\mu_{B}=e\\hbar/2m_{e}= \\tfrac{1}{2}\\alpha\\,ea_{0}\\);\n  therefore \\(|M|\\sim (\\alpha/2)\\,ea_{0}\\).\n\n* **Electric‑quadrupole (E2)** amplitudes involve an extra factor of the\n  wave‑vector \\(k=\\omega/c\\) because the operator carries one more spatial derivative,\n  giving a matrix element \\(\\sim ea_{0}^{2}k\\).\n\nConsequently\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{A_{\\rm M1}}{A_{\\rm E1}}\n    &\\sim\\left(\\frac{|M|}{|d|}\\right)^{2}\n        \\;\\approx\\;\\Bigl(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\Bigr)^{2}\n        \\;\\approx\\;5\\times10^{-5},                                   \\\\[4pt]\n\\frac{A_{\\rm E2}}{A_{\\rm E1}}\n    &\\sim(k a_{0})^{2}\n        =\\left(\\frac{\\omega a_{0}}{c}\\right)^{2}\n        \\;\\approx\\;(6\\times10^{-4})^{2}\n        \\;\\approx\\;3\\times10^{-7}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n(The numerical value uses the same \\(\\omega\\) as in part (b);

How energetic must a muon be to reach the earth’s surface if it is produced high in the atmosphere (say $\\sim 10^4 \\,\\text{m}$ up)?\n\n(b) Suppose to a zeroth approximation that the earth has a 1-gauss magnetic field pointing in the direction of its axis, extending out to $10^4 \\, \\text{m}$. How much, and in what direction, is a muon of energy $E$ normally incident at the equator deflected by the field?\n\n(c) Very high-energy protons in cosmic rays can lose energy through collision with 3-K radiation (cosmological background) in the process $p + \\gamma \\rightarrow p + \\pi$. How energetic need a proton be to be above threshold for this reaction?\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe have three parts.\n\nPart (a): Muon lifetime τ0 = 10^-6 s proper time. Need distance ~10^4 m vertical travel before decay. In lab frame, due to time dilation t_lab = γ τ0 . Must satisfy c * β * t_lab >= L? Actually muons move near speed close to c; we assume they go downwards from production point to Earth surface traveling distance d=10^4 m. So required gamma such that average path length >d. Path length ≈ v*t_lab = β c γ τ0. Since β≈1 for relativistic energies, approximate as cγτ0 ≥ d => γ≥ d/(c τ0). Compute: c = 3e8 m/s, τ0=1e-6 s → c τ0 =300 m. Then needed γ≥ 10^4 / 300 ≈33.33. So gamma about 34. Energy E = γ mc^2 where m c^2 =100 MeV. Thus total energy ≈3400 MeV = 3.4 GeV. Kinetic energy = (γ−1)m c^2 ≈(33)*100 MeV =3300 MeV ≈3.3 GeV. That's part (a).\n\nCheck more precise using β factor: For γ~34, β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²)=sqrt(1-1/1156)=√(1155/1156)=0.99957 approx. Distance traveled =β c γ τ0 = β*γ*c τ0 ≈0.9996*34*300 m =10200 m which meets requirement. Good.\n\nThus answer: around few GeV (~3–4 GeV).\n\nPart (b): Magnetic deflection over region B=1 gauss = 10⁻⁴ T. Region extends height h=10⁴ m along trajectory vertically downward. The muon enters horizontally? Wait \"normally incident at the equator\" meaning moving straight down onto Earth's surface perpendicular to surface (i.e., radial), while magnetic field points along Earth's axis (north-south). At equator, Earth's magnetic field lines are horizontal, i.e., parallel to surface, directed northward or southward. If muon moves radially inward (downward), velocity vector is perpendicular to B (since B is tangential). Therefore Lorentz force q v × B gives sideways acceleration causing curvature radius R = pc/(qB). Use momentum p = γ mv. With earlier gamma maybe variable but ask generally for any energy E. We compute lateral displacement after traversing distance L=h.\n\nAssume uniform B, small deflection angle θ <<1 so transverse deviation Δx ≈ (L²)/(2R?) Let's derive: Motion under constant perpendicular B leads circular arc radius R. Over chord length L approximated as sagitta. Angle swept φ = L/R (if L<<R). Transverse displacement (perpendicular to original line) after traveling distance L is approximately δ = R (1 - cosφ) ≈ R*(φ²/2) = L²/(2R). Direction given by right-hand rule: positive charge would curve east-west depending on sign of B and motion direction. Muon negative (μ-) vs μ+? Usually both exist. Assume muon (negative) like electron charge -e. Velocity downward (toward center); B points north (let's say +y). Using coordinate: x East, y North, z Up (radial outward). Downward velocity v = -ẑ. B = +ŷ. Force F = q(v×B) = (-e)(-ẑ × ŷ ) = (-e)( -(ẑ×ŷ)? wait cross product order: v × B = (-ẑ) × (+ŷ) = -(ẑ × ŷ) = -( -x̂ ) because ẑ × ŷ = -x̂ (using right-handed xyz). So result = -(-x̂)?? let's compute properly: Standard basis: x̂ × ŷ = ż ; ŷ × ž = x̂ ; ž × x̂ = ŷ. Also cyclic permutations. So ŷ × ž = ? Using cyc: x→y→z→x. So y × z = x. Hence z × y = -x. So indeed ẑ × ŷ = -x̂. Then (-ẑ) × ŷ = - (ẑ × ŷ) = -(-x̂) = +x̂. So v×B = +x̂ (east). Multiply by q=-e yields F = -e * (+x̂) = -e x̂ : westward. So negative muon curves toward West. Positive muon opposite.\n\nSo magnitude of deflection: δ = L² /(2R) with R = p/(|q| B) c? Actually cyclotron radius r = p/(|q| B). In SI units, r = p/(|q| B). Momentum p = γ m v ≈ γ m c (for ultra-relativistic). Write p = √(E²/c² - m²c²)/c? But easier use relation: R [meters] = (pc)/( |q| B ), since p expressed in eV/c, multiply by c to get J·s/m? Common formula: r[m]= (p[GeV/c])/(0.3 B[T]). Because p (GeV/c) divided by 0.3 B(T) gives meters. Derive: r = p/(qB) with p in kg·m/s, q=e=1.602e-19 C, B in Tesla. Convert: 1 GeV/c = 1e9*1.602e-19 J / (3e8 m/s) = 5.344e-22 kg·m/s. Plug numbers -> r(m)= (p[GeV/c]*5.344e-22)/(1.602e-19 * B) = p[GeV/c]/(0.2998 B[T]), matches known 0.3 factor.\n\nThus R = (p[GeV/c])/ (0.3 B[T]) meters.\n\nGiven B=10⁻⁴ T, then denominator 0.3*1e-4 =3e-5. So R = p[GeV/c] / 3e-5 = (3.33e4) p meters ≈ 3.3×10⁴ p (where p in GeV/c). Example for p corresponding to kinetic energy ~3 GeV, p≈E (since ultrarelativistic) ≈3 GeV/c, giving R≈1e5 m. More precisely: R≈ (3.33e4)*(3) ≈1e5 m.\n\nNow L=10⁴ m, so δ = L²/(2R) = (1e8)/(2R) =5e7 /R. Substituting R expression: δ =5e7 / (3.33e4 p) =1500/p meters. Where p in GeV/c. For p=3 GeV/c, δ≈500 m. That seems huge! Check calculation: L² = (1e4)^2 =1e8 m². Divide by 2R. If R=1e5 m, then δ=1e8/(2e5)=500 m yes. So muon deviates half km laterally—makes sense given weak field.\n\nDirection: west for µ-, east for µ+. Provide general expression: Δx ≈ (L² |q| B)/(2 p c) ??? Let's express nicely:\n\nδ ≈ \\frac{|q| B L^{2}}{2 p c}. Since R=p/(|q|B) ignoring c? Actually R = p/(|q| B). No extra c when p measured in appropriate units (SI). We'll give numeric estimate.\n\nPlug values: |q|=e=1.6e-19 C, B=1 G =1e-4 T, L=1e4 m, p = γ m v ≈ E/c (ultra). Use convenient form: δ ≈ 1.5×10³\\;\\mathrm{m}\\;( \\frac{\\rm GeV}{p}) .\n\nThus answer: about 1 km per GeV? Wait our derived 1500/p m. So for 1 GeV, 1500 m shift; for 10 GeV, 150 m etc.\n\nProvide direction: west for negatively charged muon, east for positively charged.\n\nPart (c): Threshold condition for photopion production p + γ → p + π⁰ (or π⁺?). Typically GZK cutoff uses p + γ_CMB → Δ⁺ resonance leading to pion. Threshold photon energy in proton rest frame ε'_{thr}= (m_π + m_π²/(2m_p))? Actually minimal invariant s = (m_p + m_π)^2. In lab frame (CMB photons low energy), treat head-on collisions. Condition: s = m_p^2 + 2 E_p ε (1 - cosθ) ≥ (m_p + m_π)^2. For worst case (head-on) θ=180°, (1-cosθ)=2. So threshold: 2 E_p ε ≥ (m_p+m_π)^2 - m_p^2 = 2 m_p m_π + m_π^2. Approx ignore m_π^2 relative? Keep.\n\nThus E_thr = [(m_p + m_π)^2 - m_p^2 ] / (4 ε) = (2 m_p m_π + m_π^2) / (4 ε) = (m_π (2 m_p + m_π))/ (4 ε ).\n\nTake m_p =938 MeV, m_π ≈135 MeV (neutral) or 140 MeV (charged). Use typical value 135 MeV for neutral channel. Compute numerator: m_π (2 m_p + m_π) =135 MeV *(1876+135) MeV =135*2011 MeV^2 ≈271485 MeV^2. Dividing by 4ε: ε is CMB photon energy ~ kT = 2.725 K corresponds to ε ≈ 6.35×10⁻⁴ eV (k_B T). Actually k_B=8.617e-5 eV/K, times 2.73 K = 2.35e-4 eV. Wait that's wrong: k_B*T = 2.73*K * 8.62e-5 eV/K = 2.36e-4 eV. However peak photon energy higher by factor ~2.82? Average photon energy <E> = 2.70 k_BT ≈ 6.34e-4 eV. Use epsilon ~6×10⁻⁴ eV.\n\nConvert numerator to eV^2: 2.71485e5 MeV^2 = 2.71485e11 eV^2. Denominator 4 ε = 4*6e-4 eV = 2.4e-3 eV. So E_thr ≈ (2.71e11)/(2.4e-3) eV = 1.13e14 eV ≈ 1×10¹⁴ eV = 100 TeV? Wait actual GZK threshold is ~5×10¹⁹ eV. Something off: I used neutral pion mass 135 MeV, but real threshold includes delta resonance requiring larger energy. Let's recalc correctly.\n\nStandard derivation: For p + γ → p + π⁰, threshold condition: s = m_p^2 + 2 E_p ε (1 - cosθ) ≥ (m_p + m_π)^2. Taking head-on (θ=π) gives factor 2. So 2 E_p ε ≥ (m_p + m_π)^2 - m_p^2 = 2 m_p m_π + m_π^2. Numerically: 2*m_p*m_π = 2*938*135 = 253,260 MeV^2. Add m_π^2 =18225 MeV^2 gives total ≈ 271,485 MeV^2 same as before. Now convert to Joules? Not necessary.\n\nBut note that ε should be photon energy in lab frame (CMB). Typical CMB photon energy distribution peaks at ~6.3×10⁻⁴ eV, but there is tail up to perhaps 10⁻³ eV. Using 6e-4 eV gave 1e14 eV threshold, far lower than observed GZK. Why discrepancy? Because we omitted factor of (1 - cosθ) = 2 only for exact head-on; however most interactions not exactly head-on, still similar. Yet standard GZK threshold ~5×10¹⁹ eV arises from interaction with CMB photons of average energy ~6×10⁻⁴ eV producing Δ-resonance (1232 MeV) rather than just pion plus nucleon. Indeed the effective threshold requires enough CM energy to produce Δ+, whose mass is 1232 MeV, bigger than sum of masses? Actually Δ decays into N+π, but threshold for direct N+π already accounted. Hmm why difference factor ~10⁵? Let's check unit conversion error: Our numerator was in MeV^2, converting to eV^2 multiplies by (10⁶)² =10¹². So 2.7e5 MeV^2 = 2.7e5 * (10⁶ eV)² = 2.7e5 *10¹² eV^2 = 2.7e17 eV^2, not 2.7e11. Mistake: 1 MeV = 10⁶ eV, square gives 10¹². So correct numerator: 2.71485e5 MeV^2 = 2.71485e5 *10¹² eV^2 = 2.71485e17 eV^2. Then divide by 2.4e-3 eV gives ~1.13e20 eV. Yes now aligns with GZK ~10²⁰ eV. Good.\n\nThus threshold energy E_th ≈ 1×10²⁰ eV (order hundred EeV). Using more accurate numbers may yield ~5×10¹⁹ eV considering spectrum and resonant cross-section. Provide answer: roughly 5×10¹⁹ – 10²⁰ eV.\n\nLet's present steps.\n\nCompute using average photon energy ε ≈ 6×10⁻⁴ eV. Then:\n\nE_thresh = (m_π (2 m_p + m_π))/(4 ε)\n\nInsert masses in eV: m_p = 938 MeV = 9.38×10⁸ eV, m_π = 135 MeV = 1.35×10⁸ eV.\n\nNumerator = 1.35×10⁸ eV * (2*9.38×10⁸ eV + 1.35×10⁸ eV) = 1.35×10⁸ * (1.876×10⁹ + 1.35×10⁸) ≈ 1.35×10⁸ * 2.011×10⁹ = 2.72×10¹⁷ eV².\n\nDivide by 4 ε = 4*6×10⁻⁴ = 2.4×10⁻³ eV ⇒ E_thr ≈ 1.13×10²⁰ eV.\n\nIf consider slightly higher photon energy (tail) reduces threshold

{"id": "atomic/4-3", "questions": "The Princeton synchrotron (PPA) has recently been used to accelerate highly charged nitrogen ions. If the PPA can produce protons of nominal total energy 3 GeV, what is the maximum kinetic energy of charge $6^+$ $^{14}\\text{N}$ ions?", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to interpret problem.\n\nPrinceton Synchrotron (maybe \"PSR\"?). It accelerates particles with given magnetic rigidity determined by momentum per unit charge. For same accelerator settings producing protons of total energy 3 GeV (i.e., rest mass + KE = 3 GeV), we ask max kinetic energy of N⁶+ ion (charge state +6). The accelerator's magnetic field determines momentum/charge ratio p/q constant for given Bρ. So if it can give protons up to some momentum corresponding to total energy 3 GeV, then for other species with higher q/m etc, they will have different kinetic energies but same magnetic rigidity.\n\nThus compute proton momentum from its total energy E_total=E_p = T_p + m_pc² = 3 GeV. Proton rest mass m_p c² ≈ 938.272 MeV ~0.938 GeV. Therefore kinetic energy T_p = 3 - 0.938 = 2.062 GeV.\n\nMomentum magnitude p = sqrt(E_total² - (m c²)²)/c . Using units where c=1, p = √(E² - m²).\n\nCompute:\n\nE = 3 GeV; m = 0.93827 GeV.\n\np = sqrt(9 - 0.880... ) = sqrt(8.1197) ≈ 2.849 GeV/c.\n\nNow magnetic rigidity Bρ = p / (q/e) i.e., p/(Z e). For proton Z=+1 => Bρ_proton = p/e.\n\nFor N⁶+, charge q = +6e. To achieve same Bρ, required momentum p_N = q * Bρ = 6 * Bρ_proton = 6 p_proton (since dividing by e cancels). Actually Bρ = p / (Ze). So for fixed Bρ, p scales linearly with Ze. Thus p_N = Z * p_proton = 6 * 2.849 = 17.094 GeV/c.\n\nNow find kinetic energy of N⁶+. Need rest mass of ^14N nucleus: atomic mass approx 14.003074 u. Convert to GeV: 1 u = 931.49410242 MeV. Multiply: 14.003074*931.494≈13044 MeV =13.044 GeV. But that's nuclear mass including electrons? Atomic mass includes electrons (7 electrons). However fully stripped N⁶+ loses all six electrons leaving one electron still bound? Wait N⁶+ means missing six electrons out of seven, so there remains one electron. In practice, when accelerating ions you often consider bare nuclei or partially stripped. Here it's charge +6 meaning lost six electrons, retains one electron (neutral atom would have 7 electrons). Mass difference due to missing electrons negligible (~keV). We'll approximate using nuclear mass plus remaining electron mass maybe small relative to GeV. Use atomic mass minus 6 electron masses. Electron mass 0.511 MeV each -> 6*0.000511 GeV = 0.003066 GeV. Subtract from atomic mass: 13.044 GeV - 0.00307 GeV = 13.041 GeV roughly. Good enough.\n\nSo rest mass M_N c² ≈ 13.04 GeV.\n\nTotal energy E_N = sqrt(p_N² + M_N²). Compute:\n\np_N = 17.094 GeV.\n\nM_N = 13.04 GeV.\n\nSquare them: p² = 292.20 ; M² = 170.05 ; sum =462.25 ; sqrt =21.50 GeV approximately.\n\nLet's calculate more precisely:\n\np_N² = (17.094)^2 = 292.203.\n\nM_N² = (13.041)^2 = 170.067.\n\nSum = 462.270.\n\nsqrt = 21.503.\n\nTherefore total energy about 21.5 GeV.\n\nKinetic energy T_N = E_N - M_N = 21.503 - 13.041 = 8.462 GeV.\n\nCheck scaling: Since momentum increased factor 6, kinetic energy increase not linear because relativistic.\n\nAlternative approach: use gamma formula: γ = sqrt(1+(p/Mc)²). Then K = (γ-1)Mc².\n\nCalculate β? Not needed.\n\nResult around 8.46 GeV.\n\nProvide answer as box.\n\nPotential nuance: Might ignore electron mass differences leading to slightly different value (< few MeV).

Also need minimal moderation because breeding requires fast neutrons to transmute U‑238 → Pu‑239 or Th‑232→U‑233. Water moderates too much, absorbs neutrons, so cannot be used as primary coolant/moderator in typical breeders; liquid metal coolants like Na, Pb-Bi, or gas He are preferred. Some designs use heavy water but still not ideal due to parasitic absorption.\n\nProvide brief explanation then answer subquestions. Finally give boxed answer summarizing constants and constraints.\n\nLet's craft response.assistantfinal**Brief description**\n\nA *breeder* reactor is a nuclear power plant whose core produces **more fissile nuclei than it consumes**.  \nThe usual scheme is:\n\n| Fuel | Reaction producing new fissile nuclide |\n|------|----------------------------------------|\n| \\(^{238}\\)U (fertile) | \\( ^{238}{\\rm U}+n \\rightarrow\\,^{239}{\\rm U}\\xrightarrow{\\beta^-}(23~{\\rm min})\\,^{239}{\\rm Np}\\xrightarrow{\\beta^-}(2.36~{\\rm d})\\,^{239}{\\rm Pu}\\) |\n| \\(^{232}\\)Th (fertile) | \\( ^{232}{\\rm Th}+n \\rightarrow\\,^{233}{\\rm Pa}\\xrightarrow{\\beta^-}(27~{\\rm d})\\,^{233}{\\rm U}\\) |\n\nIn the core the dominant reactions are **fast‑fission** of already present fissile isotopes (\\(^{235}\\)U, \\(^{239}\\)Pu,…). A fraction of the many neutrons released per fission does not sustain the chain reaction; instead they are captured by the surrounding fertile material and converted into fresh fissile atoms. If the net production rate exceeds the consumption rate, the reactor “breeds’’ fuel.\n\n---\n\n### Physical constant required for breeding  \n\nThe essential requirement is that **each fission event yields, on average, more than one usable neutron**. Two related quantities express this:\n\n* **Average number of neutrons emitted per fission**, \\(\\nu\\)   \n  - Typical values: \\(\\nu\\simeq 2.43\\) for thermal \\(^{235}\\)U, \\(\\nu\\simeq 2.9\\) for fast‑spectrum \\(^{239}\\)Pu.\n\n* **Neutron‑reproduction factor**, \\(\\eta = \\dfrac{\\text{neutrons produced}}{\\text{neutrons absorbed in fuel}}\\).\n\nFor any breeding system we require  \n\n\\[\n\\nu_{\\text{effective}} > 1\\qquad\\Longleftrightarrow\\qquad \\eta > 1 .\n\\]\n\nOnly when there is a **surplus of neutrons** can some be spared to transmute fertile material rather than being lost to leakage or non‑productive captures.\n\n---\n\n### Material‐selection constraint  \n\nBreeders operate in a **hard (fast) neutron spectrum** because:\n\n1. Fast neutrons have a relatively high probability of causing fission in plutonium/uranium isotopes while keeping the capture cross‑section of the fertile isotope moderate.\n2. The conversion reactions \\(^{238}\\!U(n,\\gamma)\\to^{239}\\)U and \\(^{232}\\!Th(n,\\gamma)\\to^{233}\\)Pa proceed efficiently only if the neutron energy stays above a few hundred keV; excessive slowing down would increase radiative capture without inducing fission.\n\nConsequences for construction materials:\n\n| Requirement | Reason |\n|-------------|---------|\n| Low macroscopic **absorption cross section** for neutrons | To preserve the neutron surplus needed for breeding. |\n| High **thermal conductivity** & structural strength at ≳600 °C | Breeders run hotter than light‑water reactors. |\n| Chemical compatibility / corrosion resistance with the chosen coolant | E.g., sodium reacts violently with air/water. |\n| Minimal activation under intense fast‑flux | Reduces long‑term radioactivity of structural components. |\n\nBecause of these demands, **liquid metals (Na, NaK, lead–bismuth eutectic), molten salts, or inert gases (He)** are the common coolants/moderators. They introduce little extra neutron loss and tolerate the elevated temperatures.\n\n---\n\n### Can ordinary water be used as a moderator?\n\nNo—ordinary (light) water is unsuitable for most breeder concepts:\n\n* **Strong moderation:** H₂O rapidly slows neutrons from MeV energies to ~0.025 eV, destroying the hard spectrum necessary for efficient breeding.\n* **High absorption:** Hydrogen’s microscopic capture cross‑section (~0.33 barn) removes a significant fraction of the precious surplus neutrons.\n* **Boiling point limitation:** Operating temperatures compatible with water (<350 °C at pressure) limit achievable neutron fluxes and reduce the thermodynamic efficiency of the cycle.\n\nHeavy water (D₂O) has a far lower absorption cross‑section, yet even D₂O provides too much moderation for classic fast‑breeders; it is therefore employed mainly in **thermal‑bred** systems such as CANDU‑type reactors where the goal is to breed \\(^{233}\\)U from thorium using a moderated spectrum—not in conventional fast‑breeder designs.\n\nHence, a breeder reactor must avoid moderators that absorb or overly slow neutrons; water fails both tests.\n\n---  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\textbf{Key constant for breeding: } \\nu>1\\;( \\text{or }\\eta>1 )\\\\[3pt]\n\\textbf{Material constraint: } \\text{low‑absorbing, high‑temperature tolerant,}\\\\ \n\\quad\\text{non‑moderating structures (liquid metal, molten salt, helium)}\\\\[3pt]\n\\textbf{Water as moderator? } \\displaystyle \\text{No — it over‑moderates and absorbs neutrons.}\n\\end{array}}\n\\]"}

Typical endpoint energies ~ few MeV; average neutrino about half that maybe ~0.5–1 MeV? Need estimate: In nuclear beta decay Q-values up to several MeV, e.g., neutron → proton + e− + ν̄_e releases 782 keV kinetic shared between electron (~511keV rest mass plus KE) and antineutrino. For typical allowed decays like ^14C (Q=156 keV), neutrinos low. But \"typical\" perhaps around 1 MeV. So we can say order of magnitude ∼1 MeV.\n\nBetter: The maximum neutrino energy equals Q - m_ec^2 if electron gets minimal kinetic? Actually max neutrino when electron takes zero kinetic => Eν_max = Q - me c^2 ≈ Q - 511 keV. Many decays have Q~few MeV so neutrino up to ~1‑3 MeV. Average roughly one third of Q, i.e., ~1 MeV. We'll give approximate value.\n\n(b) Lifetime dependence on Z for spontaneous electric dipole transition from 2p→1s (hydrogenic). Transition rate A ∝ ω³ |⟨f|r|i⟩|² where ω∝ΔE/ħ ∝ Z² (since energy levels scale as Z²). Matrix element ⟨r⟩ scales as a₀/Z (Bohr radius scaled). Thus A ∝ (Z²)³ * (a₀/Z)² = Z⁶ * a₀² / Z² = Z⁴ * const. Therefore lifetime τ ∝ 1/A ∝ Z^{-4}. Wait check: ΔE ∝ Z² Ry, frequency ω ∝ Z². Then ω³ ∝ Z⁶. Dipole matrix element r_ij ∝ a₀/Z . Square gives a₀²/Z². Multiply yields ∝ Z⁴. Yes. So τ ∝ Z^{-4}? Actually larger Z leads faster decay thus shorter lifetime scaling as Z^{-4}. So lifetime τ ∝ Z^{-4} times hydrogen's lifetime (τ_H≈1.6 ns?). Real numbers: Hydrogen 2p lifetime ~1.6×10^-9 s. For He+ with Z=2, τ≈(1/16)*1.6ns≈0.1 ns. Good.\n\nThus answer: τ ∝ Z^{-4}.\n\n(c) Ground-state electron configuration of neutral O atom (atomic number 8): 1s² 2s² 2p⁴. Determine term symbol using Hund’s rules. For p⁴ equivalent electrons same as two holes in p shell -> analogous to p² but reversed ordering. For p⁴, possible terms: ^3P, ^1D, ^1S. According to Hund's first rule highest multiplicity S maximal: triplet (^3P) lowest. Second rule L largest consistent with that: among ^3P only L=1. Third rule for less than half-filled shells J = |L-S| ; but here more than half filled? p subshell holds 6 electrons, we have 4 > 3, it's more than half full, so use J = L+S. However alternative viewpoint treat holes: 2 holes (<half); then J = |L - S| = 2? Let's compute correctly: For p⁴ (> half), apply rule: smallest J. Wait recall: For less than half-filled, J = L+S (max); for more than half-filled, J = |L - S| (min). Since p⁴ has more than half (more than 3), choose minimum J = |L - S| = |1 - 1| = 0. So ground term is ^3P_2 or ^3P_0? Check known data: Oxygen ground state is ^3P₂. Hmm I think actual ground level of O is ^3P₂. Indeed astrophysics uses [O III] lines from ^1D_2 etc. Let’s verify: Neutral oxygen ground term is ^3P_2 (triplet P with J=2). That suggests my application wrong. Let's re-evaluate: Number of unpaired spins S=1 (two parallel spins). L=1 (P). Now determine J values: J = L+S, L+S-1,...,|L-S| giving 2,1,0. Which is lowest energy depends on whether shell < or > half. For p-shell > half, lower J is favored (minimum). Yet observed ground is J=2 which is maximum! Something off. Maybe because LS coupling not pure due to small fine structure splitting; actual ordering may differ. Known experimental: O(^3P_2) is ground, next ^3P_1 at 158 cm-1, ^3P_0 at 227 cm-1. So indeed J=2 lowest. This contradicts simple rule? Let's double-check rule: For less-than-half-filled, J = L+S is lowest? No, standard rule: If the subshell is less than half-full, the level with the smallest J lies lowest; if more than half-full, the level with the greatest J lies lowest. Wait that's opposite earlier. Checking memory: For d-electrons example Fe II (d6 > half) ground term is ^5D_4 (largest J). So yes: More than half ⇒ largest J. So correct: For p⁴ (> half) largest J (=2) lowest. Good. So ground term ^3P_2.\n\nTherefore:\n\nConfiguration: 1s² 2s² 2p⁴,\nTotal spin quantum number S = 1 (multiplicity 2S+1 =3),\nOrbital L = 1 (P),\nTotal J = 2.\n\nProvide answer accordingly.\n\nNow craft final response with steps and box each part?

Actually for nucleus we consider protons distribution uniform within sphere radius R. Self-energy of all protons: U_C = (3/5) (Z^2 e^2)/(4π ε0 R). But there is also exchange correction maybe subtract something like -0.6 Z^(5/3)... However approximate using simple uniform sphere ignoring finite size corrections. For mirror pair differing by one unit of Z, change ΔU≈(∂U/∂Z)*ΔZ ≈ (6/5)(Ze^2)/(4π ε0 R)? Let's compute exactly: U ∝ Z^2 => ΔU = ((Z+1)^2 - Z^2) * const = (2Z +1) * const where const = (3/5) e^2 /(4π ε0 R). Here Z for lighter? Which is lower Z? Aluminum Z=13, Silicon Z=14. Mass difference given as 6 MeV presumably heavier is silicon because more Coulomb repulsion -> higher mass. So ΔM = M(Si)-M(Al)=6 MeV ≈ ΔU_coulomb = U_Z=14 - U_Z=13 = [(14^2)-(13^2)]*C = (196-169)=27*C. Wait that's not correct: 14^2=196, 13^2=169 diff=27. Indeed ΔU = 27 C. Set equal to 6 MeV → find C then get R.\n\nSo C = (3/5) e^2/(4π ε0 R). Solve for R: R = (3/5) e^2/(4π ε0 C). Compute numeric values: e^2/(4π ε0) = α ħ c ≈ 1.44 MeV·fm. More precisely 1.439964... MeV fm. Then C = (3/5)*(1.44 MeV·fm)/R = (0.864 MeV·fm)/R. Because 3/5=0.6, times 1.44 =0.864.\n\nThus ΔU =27*C =27*(0.864/R) MeV =23.328 / R MeV·fm/fm?? Actually units: C has MeV·fm / fm = MeV, so fine. So set 23.328 / R = 6 MeV ⇒ R = 23.328/6 = 3.888 fm approx 3.9 fm.\n\nAlternatively could use typical nuclear radius scaling R=r_0 A^{1/3}. With A=27, r_0~1.2 fm yields R≈1.2*27^{1/3}=1.2*3≈3.6 fm close.\n\nThus answer about 4 fm.\n\nNow produce final answer with box.\n\nLet's craft explanation step-by-step.\n\nassistantfinal**(a) Electrostatic self‑energy of a uniformly charged sphere**\n\nLet a total charge \\(Q\\) be spread homogeneously inside a solid sphere of radius \\(R\\).\nThe volume charge density is  \n\n\\[\n\\rho=\\frac{Q}{\\tfrac43\\pi R^{3}} .\n\\]\n\nThe electric field produced by this charge distribution is obtained from Gauss’ law.\n\n*Inside (\\(r<R\\)):*\n\n\\[\nE(r)=\\frac{\\rho\\, r}{3\\varepsilon_{0}}\n      =\\frac{Qr}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}R^{3}}\\qquad (r<R)\n\\]\n\n*Outside (\\(r>R\\)):*\n\n\\[\nE(r)=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}r^{2}},\\qquad (r>R)\n\\]\nwhich will not contribute to the **self‑energy**, since that comes only from the fields generated by the charges themselves (the external region can be omitted if we build the sphere shell by shell).\n\nThe electrostatic energy stored in the field is  \n\n\\[\nU=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}}{2}\\int_{\\mathbb {R}^{3}} E^{2}\\,d\\tau .\n\\]\n\nInsert the interior expression for \\(E(r)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU &=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}}{2}\\int_{0}^{R} \n        \\left[\\frac{Qr}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}R^{3}}\\right]^{2}\n        4\\pi r^{2}\\,dr \\\\[4pt]\n   &=\\frac{1}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}}\\,\n     \\frac{Q^{2}}{R^{6}}\\;\n       \\underbrace{\\int_{0}^{R} r^{4}\\,dr}_{R^{5}/5}\\\\[4pt]\n   &=\\frac{1}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}}\\,\n     \\frac{Q^{2}}{R^{6}}\\;\\frac{R^{5}}{5}\n    =\\boxed{\\displaystyle \n          \\frac{3}{5}\\,\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}}\\,\n          \\frac{Q^{2}}{R}} .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nHence the familiar result  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{U_{\\rm sph}= \\frac{3}{5}\\,\\frac{Q^{2}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}R}} .\n\\]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(b) Radius estimate from the mass difference of the mirror nuclei  \n\\(^{27}_{14}\\mathrm{Si}\\) and \\(^{27}_{13}\\mathrm{Al}\\)**  \n\nFor a nucleus we treat the protons as a uniformly charged sphere of radius \\(R\\).   \nIf the atomic number is \\(Z\\), its Coulomb (electrostatic) self–energy is, from part (a),\n\n\\[\nU_{C}(Z)=\\frac{3}{5}\\,\\frac{Z^{2}e^{2}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}R}.\n\\]\n\nThe two isotopes differ by one proton:\n\\[\n\\Delta U_{C}=U_{C}(Z=14)-U_{C}(Z=13)\n            =\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}R}\n               \\bigl[(14)^{2}-(13)^{2}\\bigr].\n\\]\n\nSince \\((14)^{2}-(13)^{2}=196-169=27\\),\n\n\\[\n\\Delta U_{C}=27\\;\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}R}.\n\\]\n\nIn nuclear physics it is customary to write  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}}=\n\\alpha\\hbar c\\simeq 1.44\\ {\\rm MeV\\;fm},\n\\]\n\nso that  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}}\n           =0.60\\times1.44\\ {\\rm MeV\\;fm}=0.864\\ {\\rm MeV\\;fm}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore  \n\n\\[\n\\Delta U_{C}=27\\;\\frac{0.864\\ {\\rm MeV\\;fm}}{R}\n             =\\frac{23.33\\ {\\rm MeV\\;fm}}{R}.\n\\]\n\nExperimentally the mass (and thus the rest‑energy) difference between the two mirror nuclei is reported as  \n\n\\[\n\\Delta M c^{2}=6\\ {\\rm MeV}\\approx\\Delta U_{C}.\n\\]\n\nEquating the two expressions,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{23.33}{R}=6\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\nR\\simeq\\frac{23.33}{6}\\ {\\rm fm}\\approx 3.9\\ {\\rm fm}.\n\\]\n\nThis value is consistent with the empirical nuclear‐radius systematics  \n\\(R=r_{0}A^{1/3}\\) with \\(r_{0}\\simeq1.2\\ {\\rm fm}\\):\n\\[\nR\\approx1.2\\,(27)^{1/3}\\ {\\rm fm}\\approx1.2\\times3.0\\ {\\rm fm}=3.6\\ {\\rm fm}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{(a)} & U = \\displaystyle\\frac{3}{5}\\,\\frac{Q^{2}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}R},\\\\[10pt]\n\\text{(b)} & R \\approx 4\\ \\text{fm}\\;( \\text{more precisely } \\;3.9\\ \\text{fm}) .\n\\end{array}}\n\\]"}

Probably heavy nucleus so μ≈m_n (approx). Then k = sqrt(2μE)/ħ . Compute numeric value maybe needed for absolute magnitude? But they may want expression up to factor 1/k² times sum squares etc. Since we have only two terms, compute f(θ):\n\nLet A0 = e^{iδ0} sinδ0 ; A1 = 3 e^{iδ1} sinδ1 cosθ (since P1(x)=x).\n\nThus f = (1/k)[A0 + A1].\n\nCompute magnitudes: Convert degrees to radians: δ0=π/6 rad (~0.523599), sinδ0=0.5, e^{iδ0}=cos30°+ i sin30° = √3/2 + i*1/2.\n\nSo A0 = (√3/2 + i/2)*0.5 = (√3/4)+ i*(1/4) .\n\nSimilarly δ1=10° => rad ≈ π/18 = 0.174533 rad. sinδ1≈0.173648. cosδ1≈0.984807. e^{iδ1}=0.9848 + i 0.17365.\n\nMultiply: A1_factor = 3 sinδ1 e^{iδ1} = 3*0.173648*(0.9848+i0.17365) = 0.520944*(0.9848+i0.17365) = let's compute: real part 0.520944*0.9848 ≈ 0.513... compute precisely: 0.520944*0.9848 = 0.5129. Imag part: 0.520944*0.17365 = 0.09044. So A1 = (0.5129 + i 0.09044) * cosθ.\n\nNow f = (1/k)[ (0.4330127?? Wait earlier A0 real = √3/4 ≈0.433013, imag=0.25 ) plus A1*cosθ ].\n\nActually A0 = (√3/4)+(i/4) = 0.4330127019 + i 0.25.\n\nAdd A1 term multiplied by cosθ.\n\nTherefore f = (1/k)[ (0.4330 + i0.25) + (0.5129 + i0.09044) cosθ ].\n\nThen modulus squared: |f|² = (1/k²) [ ... ]. Let’s denote X = Re part, Y = Im part.\n\nX = 0.4330 + 0.5129 cosθ,\nY = 0.25 + 0.09044 cosθ.\n\nHence |f|² = (1/k²)(X² + Y²).\n\nThus dσ/dΩ = (1/k²)[ (0.4330 + 0.5129 c)^2 + (0.2500 + 0.09044 c)^2 ], where c = cosθ.\n\nNow evaluate at angles:\n\nθ=30°, cos=√3/2≈0.8660254.\n\nc=0.8660.\n\nCompute X: 0.4330 + 0.5129*0.8660 = 0.4330 + 0.4442 ≈ 0.8772.\n\nY: 0.25 + 0.09044*0.8660 = 0.25 + 0.07833 ≈ 0.32833.\n\nSquare: X²=0.7695, Y²=0.1078 → sum=0.8773.\n\nThus dσ/dΩ = 0.8773 / k².\n\nNext θ=45°, cos=√2/2≈0.70710678.\n\nX = 0.4330 + 0.5129*0.7071 = 0.4330 + 0.3625 = 0.7955.\n\nY = 0.25 + 0.09044*0.7071 = 0.25 + 0.06396 = 0.31396.\n\nSquares: X²=0.6329, Y²=0.09855 -> sum=0.7315.\n\nThus dσ/dΩ = 0.7315 / k².\n\nθ=90°, cos=0.\n\nX = 0.4330 , Y = 0.25.\n\nSum squares: 0.4330²=0.1875, 0.25²=0.0625 => total=0.25.\n\nThus dσ/dΩ = 0.25 / k².\n\nNeed numerical value using k. Let's compute k.\n\nAssume neutron mass m_n = 939.565 MeV/c². Energy 5 MeV kinetic in cm frame. Nonrelativistic approximation: momentum p = sqrt(2 m_n E) . In natural units ħc =197.327 MeV·fm. So k = p/ħ = sqrt(2 m_n E)/ħ.\n\nCalculate: 2*m_n*E = 2*939.565*5 = 9395.65 MeV². Square root gives sqrt(9395.65) ≈ 96.93 MeV. Divide by ħc (197.327 MeV fm): Actually dividing by ħ yields k (in fm⁻¹) because p (MeV/c) divided by ħc (MeV·fm) gives 1/fm. So k = 96.93 / 197.327 = 0.491 fm^{-1}. Good.\n\nThus 1/k² = (1)/(0.241) ≈ 4.149 fm².\n\nCheck: k² = 0.241, invert = 4.15 fm².\n\nNow multiply each result:\n\nAt 30°: σ_diff = 0.8773 * 4.149 = 3.64 fm².\n\nAt 45°: 0.7315 * 4.149 = 3.03 fm².\n\nAt 90°: 0.25 * 4.149 = 1.04 fm².\n\nConvert to barns perhaps (1 barn =100 fm²?). Actually 1 b = 100 fm². So these correspond to 0.0364 b, 0.0303 b, 0.0104 b respectively.\n\nPlot would show decreasing with angle.\n\nTotal cross section: σ_total = ∫ dΩ dσ/dΩ = (4π/k²) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l . Because orthogonality leads to integrated cross section independent of interference between different l's. Indeed σ_tot = (4π/k²) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l.\n\nOnly l=0,1 contribute.\n\nSinδ0 = 0.5 ⇒ sin²δ0 = 0.25.\n\nSinδ1 = 0.173648 ⇒ sin²δ1 = 0.0301537.\n\nThus contribution: (2*0+1)=1 *0.25 =0.25 ; (2*1+1)=3 *0.03015 =0.09046.\n\nSum =0.34046.\n\nTimes 4π/k² : 4π/k² = 12.566 * 4.149 = 52.13 fm².\n\nMultiplying: σ = 52.13 * 0.34046 = 17.75 fm².\n\nIn barns: divide by 100 => 0.1775 b.\n\nAlternatively could present as 1.775×10^-28 m² (since 1 fm² = 1e-30 m²). That's 1.775e-28 m².\n\nPart (b): Negligible higher partial waves implies centrifugal barrier prevents penetration beyond some radius R such that ℓ_max determined by condition ℓ_max(ℓ_max+1)ħ²/(2µR²) ≤ E. If only ℓ≤1 matter then ℓ=2 already suppressed meaning its effective wave number inside region small. Estimate maximum impact parameter b~R corresponds to angular momentum L = µ v b = ħ ℓ. Using k = µv/ħ, thus ℓ ≈ kb. Set ℓ=2 threshold when kR ≲ 2. So if ℓ=2 negligible, require kR < 2 roughly. With our computed k=0.49 fm⁻¹, this gives R < 2/0.49 ≈ 4.1 fm. Thus nuclear potential range less than about 4 fm. More quantitatively, since ℓ=2 contributes negligibly, sinδ₂≈0 implying no interaction within distance >R. The classical turning point for ℓ=2: V_eff = ℏ² ℓ(ℓ+1)/(2µ r²). Setting equal to kinetic energy E gives r_c = ℏ sqrt[ℓ(ℓ+1)] /(sqrt{2µE}) = ℓ(ℓ+1)^(½)/k.

In natural units: e^2 ≈ 1.44 MeV·fm. So V(MeV)= (Z1*Z2)*(1.44)/r(fm).\n\nNuclear radius approx r≈1.2 A^{1/3} fm; for C-12, A^(1/3)≈(12)^(1/3)≈2.29 => r≈2.75 fm. Then V≈ (1*6)*1.44/2.75 ≈8.64/2.75≈3.14 MeV. That's about a few MeV.\n\nIf target is hydrogen (proton-proton), Z=1 each -> V≈1.44/r with r~2 fm gives ~0.7 MeV. But protons don't fuse easily due to weak interaction etc but barrier still ~100 keV?

For β+ decay, max positron total energy equals Q - neutrino zero approx; but includes rest mass already counted? Usually endpoint kinetic energy T_max = Q - 2 m_e c^2 because you need create positron-electron pair? Wait: In beta-plus decay, parent nucleus transforms p → n + e+ + ν_e . Energy release Q = [M_parent - M_daughter]c^2 - 2 m_e c^2 (since daughter atom has extra electron). But they give \"maximum (kinetic energy + m_e c^2) energy\" i.e., total relativistic energy E_total = K + m_e c^2 = maybe equal to Q? Let's interpret: They say maximum (kinetic energy + m_e c^2) energy of the positron is 3.48 MeV. So that's the total energy including rest mass. That would correspond to Q-value minus negligible recoil etc. So we can take ΔMc² ≈ 3.48 MeV.\n\nThus mass difference between nuclei (including electrons?) corresponds to Coulomb energy change when moving from Z=14 to Z=13 with same A. Since nuclear masses differ mainly due to electrostatic self-energy differences.\n\nCoulomb energy of uniform sphere: U_C = (3/5)(Z(Z-1)e^2)/(4π ε₀ R)? Actually formula for self-energy of uniformly charged sphere of total charge Ze: U = (3/5)*(Z^2 e^2)/(4π ε₀ R). Some include factor (Z(Z-1)) approximated as Z^2 for large Z ignoring self-interaction of each proton with itself. We'll approximate using Z^2.\n\nSo mass difference ΔM c^2 ≈ ΔU_C = U(14)-U(13).\n\nCompute:\n\nU_Z = k * Z^2 / R where k = (3e^2)/(20 π ε₀ )? Let's compute numeric constant later.\n\nSince both have same radius scaling with A^(1/3), assume same R (same A). Then ΔU = k/R *(14^2 - 13^2)=k/R*(196-169)=k/R*27.\n\nSet this equal to observed energy 3.48 MeV.\n\nSolve for R then r0 via R=r0*A^{1/3}, A=27 => A^{1/3}=27^{1/3}=~3.0 (since 3^3=27). Indeed exactly 3.\n\nTherefore R = 3 r0.\n\nNow find k.\n\nElectrostatic constant: e^2/(4π ε₀) = α ħ c ≈ 1.44 MeV·fm.\n\nThen U = (3/5)* (Z^2 e^2)/(4π ε₀ R) = (3/5)*(Z^2 * 1.44 MeV fm)/R(fm)\n\n=> coefficient C = (3/5)*1.44 = 0.864 MeV·fm.\n\nThus U = 0.864 * Z^2 / R(MeV).\n\nHence ΔU = 0.864 / R * (Z1^2-Z2^2) = 0.864 / R *27.\n\nSet equal 3.48 MeV.\n\nThus R = 0.864*27 / 3.48 = (23.328) / 3.48 ≈ 6.70 fm.\n\nCheck calculation: 0.864*27 = 23.328 indeed. Divide by 3.48 gives about 6.704 fm.\n\nThus R≈6.7 fm.\n\nBut typical nuclear radii ~1.2 fm per nucleon cube root times A^{1/3}. With A=27, expected R≈1.2*3=3.6 fm. Our result double that—maybe our assumption missing factor Z(Z-1) vs Z^2 or other constants.\n\nLet's try more accurate expression: Self-energy of uniformly charged sphere with point charges not interacting with themselves leads to U = (3/5)*(Z(Z-1) e^2)/(4π ε₀ R). Use Z(Z-1): For Z=14, product 14*13=182 ; for Z=13, 13*12=156 ; diff =26. That's close to earlier 27 but slightly less.

How can this $A$ dependence be understood? This implies an important property of nucleon-nucleon forces. What is it called? Why is a neutron bound in a nucleus stable against decay while a lambda particle in a hypernucleus is not?", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to answer several parts:\n\n1) Binding energy per nucleus vs A scaling: The semi-empirical mass formula says volume term ~ a_v * A; surface term ~ -a_s*A^{2/3}; Coulomb etc. So overall binding energy B ≈ a_v A – a_s A^(2/3)… For heavy nuclei, leading term linear with A. Not quadratic.\n\nThus binding energy roughly proportional to A, not A^2. Coefficient a_v about 15–16 MeV per nucleon. Actually total binding energy = a_v A where a_v≈15.8 MeV. Units MeV.\n\nExplain why: short-range nuclear force saturates—each nucleon interacts only with nearest neighbors (~constant number), so total binding ∝ number of nucleons → linear.\n\nThis property is \"saturation\" of nuclear forces / saturation of binding energy.\n\nSecond part: Neutron inside nucleus cannot beta-decay because its decay n→p+e−+ν̄_e would increase total energy due to Pauli blocking: proton states already filled up to Fermi level; also mass difference between neutron and proton plus electron is small (0.782 MeV); within nucleus, if resulting proton would have higher energy than available levels, decay forbidden. In contrast, Λ hyperon decays weakly via Λ→ p + π⁻ (or n + π⁰) with Q~37 MeV free. Inside hypernucleus, even though some nucleon states may be occupied, there remains enough phase space for pion emission and conversion to lower-energy nucleon state; also strong interaction mixing leads to non-saturation for strange baryons—they feel less attractive potential, thus λ is less deeply bound but still above threshold for mesonic decay unless very deep potentials suppress pion emission (non-mesonic decay dominates).\n\nBut question asks: why neutron bound in nucleus stable against decay while Lambda in hypernucleus is not? Because neutron's β‑decay is blocked by Pauli principle (energy conservation) whereas Λ decay proceeds through weak interaction emitting a pion which carries away momentum allowing final nucleon to occupy unfilled low-energy state; also mass difference larger (~177 MeV?) Wait actual masses: m_Λ=1115.683 MeV, m_n=939.565 MeV, m_p=938.272 MeV.

Physical origin : **Saturation of the nuclear force**\n\nEach nucleon feels the strong interaction only from its immediate neighbours (the range of the NN force is \\(\\sim 1\\) fm, comparable to the inter‑particle spacing). Consequently a given nucleon contributes almost a fixed amount of attraction irrespective of how many other nucleons are present. When you add another nucleon you gain approximately the same extra binding as before ⇒ **total binding scales with the number of particles**, i.e. linearly with \\(A\\).\n\n*This property is called the **saturation of nuclear forces*** (or simply **force saturation**).\n\nIf the force were long ranged and each nucleon interacted equally with all others, the binding would scale as \\(A^{2}\\) (as in gravitation or electrostatics).

If all proton states up to the Fermi level are already filled (Pauli blocking) the required final state either does not exist or lies too high in energy, making the net change in nuclear energy positive. Hence the decay becomes **energetically forbidden** and the neutron is effectively stable while bound.\n\n### Bound \\(\\Lambda\\) hyperon\n\nFor a \\(\\Lambda\\) the dominant weak channel is  \n\n\\[\n\\Lambda \\rightarrow p + \\pi^{-}\\quad ({\\rm or }\\; n+\\pi^{0}),\n\\]\nwith a huge released energy  \n\n\\[\nQ_{\\rm free}=m_\\Lambda-m_N-m_\\pi \\simeq 1115.68-938.27-139.57\\;{\\rm MeV}\n            \\approx 37.8\\ {\\rm MeV},\n\\]\n\nfar larger than any nuclear shell gaps.

We have charged meson moving in uniform magnetic field; radius of curvature rho relates momentum p via p = q * B * rho . Actually relation: p [GeV/c] = 0.3 * B[T]*ρ[m] times charge magnitude e. More precisely p (SI units): p = q B ρ . For unit charge e=1.602e-19 C, but we can use convenient conversion factor: p(MeV/c)= 300*B(T)*ρ(m). Wait constant: p(GeV/c) = 0.299792458 * B[T] * ρ[m]; So p(MeV/c) ≈ 299.79 * B*T*m? Let's calculate: 0.3 GeV per T·m => 300 MeV/(T·m). Yes approximate. Use exact maybe not needed due to two significant figures.\n\nGiven (ρ B)_1 = 2.7 T·m ; then p1c = 0.3 GeV/T·m × 2.7 = 0.81 GeV/c = 810 MeV/c. Using more precise 0.2998 gives 0.80946 GeV/c ~ 809 MeV/c.\n\nSimilarly (ρ B)_2 = 0.34 -> p2c = 0.3×0.34 = 0.102 GeV/c = 102 MeV/c.\n\nAssume meson has charge +e or -e; sign irrelevant for magnitude.\n\nNow find rest mass from these data plus measured v2 = 1.8E8 m/s (~0.6 c). Compute gamma for second state:\n\nβ2 = v2 / c where c≈3.00e8 → β2 = 1.8/3 = 0.60 exactly. Then γ2 = 1/√(1-β²) = 1/√(1-0.36) = 1/√(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.\n\nMomentum p2 = γ m v = γ m β c. In terms of mc: p = γ β m c. So p2c = γ β m c^2? Wait p*c = γ β m c^2? No: p = γ m v = γ m β c. Multiply both sides by c: pc = γ β m c^2. Good.\n\nThus m c^2 = pc /(γ β). We know pc = p2c = about 102 MeV. γ=1.25, β=0.6 so denominator = 0.75. Therefore m c^2 = 102 /0.75 =136 MeV. That's close to pion mass (139.6 MeV). Two figure accuracy likely 140 MeV.\n\nLet's compute with more accurate numbers using 0.2998 factor: p2c = 0.2998*0.34 = 0.1019 GeV = 101.9 MeV. Divide by 0.75 =135.9 MeV. Round to 140 MeV (two sig figs). We'll present 1.4×10^2 MeV.\n\nNow kinetic energy before and after.\n\nKinetic energy K = (γ−1)m c^2.\n\nFor slow case: γ2=1.25, m c^2~136 MeV ⇒ K2=(0.25)(136)=34 MeV approx. With rounding 30 MeV? Two fig maybe 34 MeV.\n\nCompute more accurately: if m=136 MeV, K2=0.25*136=34 MeV.\n\nAlternatively could compute directly from total energy E = sqrt(p^2c^2+m^2c^4); subtract rest mass. But fine.\n\nNow for first high-energy meson: Need γ1 based on momentum p1c = 810 MeV. Use relationship p = γ β m c. Also β = √(1-1/γ^2). Solve for γ from known p/mc.\n\nLet x = p/(mc) = p1c / (m c^2) = 810 / 136 ≈ 5.96.\n\nBut p/(mc) = γ β. And recall γ^2 - (γ β)^2 = 1 (since γ^2 - (γβ)^2 = 1). Because γ^2 - (γβ)^2 = γ^2 (1-β^2) = γ^2 /γ^2 =1. Indeed identity: (γβ)^2 = γ^2 -1.\n\nSo let y = γβ = x =5.96. Then γ = sqrt(x^2+1) = sqrt(35.52+1)=sqrt(36.52)=6.04. Then β = x/γ =5.96/6.04=0.987. Check consistency: β near 0.99.\n\nThen kinetic energy K1 = (γ-1) m c^2 = (6.04-1)*136 =5.04*136 ≈686 MeV. Rounded 690 MeV.\n\nAlternative using more precise values may give around 700 MeV.\n\nNow part b: The 'slow' meson has 50% probability of decaying within distance L_lab = 4 m. That means survival fraction exp(-t/τ_lab?) Actually decay law N=N0 exp(-t/τ'), where τ' is lifetime dilated in lab: τ' = γ τ_rest. Probability of decay within distance d equals 1 - exp(-d/(β c τ')). Given P_decay =0.5 when d=4 m. So exp(-d/(β c τ')) = 0.5 => d/(β c τ') = ln2 => τ' = d/(β c ln2). Then proper lifetime τ = τ'/γ.\n\nCalculate: β=0.6, c=3.00e8 m/s, d=4 m, ln2≈0.6931.\n\nFirst compute denominator: β c ln2 = 0.6 * 3e8 * 0.6931 = 0.6*3e8=1.8e8; multiply by 0.6931 => 1.24758e8 m/s.\n\nThus τ' = 4 / 1.24758e8 s = 3.207e-8 s ≈ 32 ns? Wait compute: 4 / 1.247e8 = 3.206e-8 seconds = 32 nanoseconds? Actually 3.2e-8 sec = 32 ns? No 1 ns = 1e-9 s, so 3.2e-8 s = 32 ns indeed.\n\nNow proper lifetime τ = τ'/γ = 3.206e-8 / 1.25 = 2.565e-8 s = 26 ns.\n\nHalf-life t_{1/2} in rest frame related to mean lifetime τ by t_{1/2}= τ ln2 = τ *0.6931. Wait careful: Exponential decay N(t)=N0 e^{-t/τ}, where τ is mean lifetime. Half-life satisfies e^{-t_half/τ}=0.5 => t_half = τ ln2. So t_half_rest = τ ln2 = 2.565e-8 *0.6931 = 1.777e-8 s ≈ 18 ns.\n\nProvide result perhaps 1.8×10^-8 s.\n\nNow also ask \"distance that 50% of the initial full-energy mesons would travel in the laboratory frame.\" Means starting with original fast meson (energy corresponding to earlier stage), what distance will they go before half have decayed? Their velocity higher (β1). Determine their lab-frame half-distance D such that probability of surviving until traveling D is 0.5 i.e., D = β1 c τ'_full * ln2? Actually similar formula: D = β1 c τ'_full ln2 where τ'_full = γ1 τ (mean lifetime dilated). Since we want distance traveled before half decay, set exponential in lab time: N(D) = N0 exp[-D/(β1 c τ')] = 0.5 => D = β1 c τ' ln2. Where τ'=γ1 τ (proper mean lifetime). Equivalent to D = β1 c γ1 τ ln2.\n\nWe already computed τ (rest mean lifetime) = 2.56e-8 s. γ1 ≈6.04. β1≈0.987.\n\nCompute product: β1 γ1 = 0.987*6.04 = 5.96 (makes sense equal to p/(mc)). Then D = c * (β1 γ1 τ) * ln2? Wait expression includes extra ln2 again? Already accounted: D = β1 c τ' ln2 = β1 c γ1 τ ln2. Plug numbers: β1 c = 0.987 * 3e8 = 2.961e8 m/s. Times γ1 τ = 6.04 * 2.565e-8 = 1.549e-7 s. Multiplying: 2.961e8 * 1.549e-7 = 45.86 m. Now multiply by ln2?? I think we double counted because we used τ' which is mean lifetime, not half-life. The condition for 50% decay uses exponent -t/τ', setting exp(-t/τ')=0.5 leads t = τ' ln2. Similarly distance D = β c t = β c τ' ln2. So yes include ln2 once. Our calculation above didn't yet multiply by ln2? Wait we multiplied β c * γ τ (that's β c τ'). Not yet Ln2. Let's recompute correctly:\n\nStep: τ = proper mean lifetime = 2.565e-8 s.\n\nMean lifetime in lab for fast meson: τ'_fast = γ1 τ = 6.04 * 2.565e-8 = 1.55e-7 s.\n\nTime to halve: t_half_fast = τ'_fast ln2 = 1.55e-7 * 0.6931 = 1.074e-7 s.\n\nDistance = β1 c * t_half_fast = 0.987 * 3e8 * 1.074e-7 = 0.987*3e8 = 2.961e8; times 1.074e-7 = 31.8 m.\n\nCheck alternative method: D = β1 c γ1 τ ln2 = (β1 γ1) c τ ln2 = 5.96 * 3e8 * 2.565e-8 *0.6931 = let's compute: 5.96 * 3e8 = 1.788e9; times 2.565e-8 = 45.85; times 0.6931 = 31.78 m matches previous.\n\nThus distance ~ 32 m.\n\nAnswer summary:\n\nRest mass ≈ 1.4×10^2 MeV/c^2.\n\nKinetic energies:\nBefore slowing: ≈ 6.9×10^2 MeV (≈ 7.0×10^2 MeV)\nAfter slowing: ≈ 3.4×10^1 MeV (≈ 34 MeV)\n\nIntrinsic half‑life (particle’s own frame): ≈ 1.8×10⁻⁸ s.\n\nLab‑frame distance for 50% decay of initially energetic mesons: ≈ 3.2×10¹ m (≈ 32 m).\n\nNeed box formatting.\n\nassistantfinal**Solution**\n\nThe transverse motion of a relativistic charged particle in a uniform magnetic field obeys  \n\n\\[\np =q\\,B\\rho ,\n\\qquad   p(\\text{MeV}/c)\\;\\approx\\;

{"id": "atomic/4-5", "questions": "The mass of a muon is approximately $100 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2$ and its lifetime at rest is approximately two microseconds. How much energy would a muon need to circumnavigate the earth with a fair chance of completing the journey, assuming that the earth’s magnetic field is strong enough to keep it in orbit? Is the earth’s field actually strong enough?", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to interpret question: Muon mass ~100 MeV/c² (actually about 105.7 MeV). Lifetime τ0 = 2 µs ≈ 2×10⁻6 s. Need gamma factor such that dilated lifetime γτ0 > time needed to travel around Earth once.\n\nCircumference L = 2πR_E where R≈6371 km => L≈40075 km = 4.0075e7 m.\n\nIf moving near speed v close to c, travel time t = L / v ≈ L / c if relativistic. So required proper time dilation factor:\n\nγ ≥ t/τ0 = (L/c)/τ0.\n\nCompute L/c: L=4.0e7 m; c=3e8 m/s → L/c ≈ 0.133 s (~133 ms).\n\nDivide by τ0=2e-6 s gives γ≥ 0.133/2e-6 = 66500 approx.\n\nThus need Lorentz factor ~7×10⁴. Corresponding kinetic energy E_k = (γ -1) mc². With m c² ≈ 106 MeV, so KE ≈ (γ)*m c² roughly because γ>>1: KE ≈ γ * 106 MeV ≈ 7×10⁶ MeV = 7 TeV? Wait compute: 7e4*1e2 MeV = 7e6 MeV = 7 GeV? Actually 1 MeV times 1e2 yields 100 MeV per unit. Let's calculate precisely: γ~6.65e4, multiply by 105.66 MeV -> ~7.03e9 MeV = 7.0 ×10³ GeV = 7 TeV. Yes that's correct: 7 TeV.\n\nSo muon needs about several TeV kinetic energy to survive one lap.\n\nNow second part: Earth's magnetic field strength B ~30–60 μT at surface. For charged particle moving perpendicular to B, radius r = p/(qB), where momentum p = γmv. q = e magnitude. Want r equal Earth's radius (or maybe less but comparable). Compute required momentum for given B and curvature radius R≈6.37e6 m.\n\np = q B r. Using SI units: q=e=1.602e-19 C, B~50 μT =5e-5 T, r=6.4e6 m. Then p = 1.602e-19 *5e-5 *6.4e6 = 1.602e-19 *320 ≈ 5.13e-17 kg·m/s? Let's compute more accurately: 5e-5*6.4e6 = 320. Multiply by 1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-17 kg·m/s. Convert to momentum in MeV/c: p [GeV/c] = (p [kg·m/s]) * c / (1.783e-27 kg·(GeV/c)). Since 1 GeV/c corresponds to 1.783e-27 kg·m/s. So p_GeV = p*c / (1.783e-27). But we have already p in kg·m/s. Use conversion: 1 GeV/c = 5.344285...e-19 kg·m/s? Let me recall: Momentum p (SI) = (E(MeV))/c * β . Better use formula: 1 eV/c = 5.344286e-28 kg·m/s. Therefore 1 GeV/c = 5.344e-19 kg·m/s. Check: yes. So our p =5.13e-17 kg·m/s divided by 5.34e-19 =96.2 GeV/c. That's huge! So to bend into radius Earth using typical B you'd need momentum ~100 GeV/c, corresponding to total energy ~ sqrt(p^2 + m^2)c^2 ≈ p c since p >> m. Energy ~100 GeV, which is larger than earlier estimate of 7 TeV? Wait 100 GeV << 7 TeV. Something inconsistent: The previous requirement from decay gave gamma ~66000 leading to momentum p = γ mv ≈ γ m c (since v≈c). m c = 105 MeV/c, thus p ≈ γ * 105 MeV/c = 6.6e4 * 0.105 GeV/c = 6930 GeV/c = 6.9 TeV/c. Indeed momentum ~7 TeV/c. That far exceeds what Earth's magnetic field can confine within Earth radius (needs only 100 GeV). However note that higher momentum leads to larger gyroradius proportionally; for same B, r ∝ p/qB. If you have p=7 TeV/c then r = p/(eB)= (7e12 MeV)/(???) let's compute ratio: r_needed/r_earth = p_required/p_Bfield_for_R = 7TeV / 0.1TeV =70. So actual radius would be ~70 Earth radii, i.e., not bound.\n\nTherefore Earth's magnetic field insufficient to hold such high-energy muons in low-orbit; they'd escape or require additional forces.\n\nAlternatively could consider lower altitude path along geomagnetic lines etc., but still unrealistic.\n\nHence answer: need about few TeV kinetic energy; Earth's field cannot contain them – maximum stable orbital momentum limited to ~100 GeV giving too short lifetime (<microsecond?). At that momentum gamma ~ p/mc ≈ 100 GeV / 0.106 GeV ≈ 945, resulting dilated lifetime ~ 2µs *945 ≈ 1.9 ms, still far shorter than travel time 0.13 s, so they wouldn't make full circle.\n\nProvide calculations steps.\n\nLet's craft final response with formulas, numbers, concluding box.\n\nassistantfinal**Step‑by‑step**\n\n---\n\n### 1.

", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to list three nuclear reactions considered for controlled thermonuclear fusion (i.e., D-T, D-D, D-He3 maybe).

Also give approximate energy releases per reaction (MeV) and how resultant neutrons could be used.\n\nProvide details:\n\n1. Deuterium‑tritium (D + T → ^4He + n + 17.6 MeV)\n2. Deuterium‑deuterium (two branches):\n   - D + D → ^3He + n + 3.27 MeV\n   - D + D → T + p + 4.03 MeV\n   Overall average about 4 MeV per reaction.\n3. Deuterium‑helium‑3 (D + ^3He → ^4He + p + 18.3 MeV), or perhaps proton-boron11 (p+^11B→3α+8.7 MeV) but that is aneutronic. But \"currently considered\" includes D‑He3 as alternative because it produces no neutron directly (but some secondary). Could also include He3‑He3 etc. However typical set: D‑T, D‑D, D‑He3. We'll present those.\n\nLargest cross-section: D‑T with σ_max ≈ 5 barn at center-of-mass energy ∼64 keV.\n\nNeutron usage: In D‑T reactors, high-energy 14.1 MeV neutrons can breed tritium via blanket of lithium (^6Li(n,α)^3H, ^7Li(n,n'α)^3H); they deposit heat in breeding blanket and structural materials, enabling power extraction; also produce radioisotopes, cause material damage, require shielding.\n\nAlso discuss using neutrons for medical isotopes, materials testing, subcritical fission, etc.\n\nNeed to output final answer in LaTeX boxed form.\n\nWill structure response: Step-by-step reasoning then final box summarizing key numbers.\n\nLet's craft answer.assistantfinal**Step‑by‑step**\n\n1. **Identify the reactions most widely studied for magnetic‐or inertial confinement fusion.**  \n   The three “canonical’’ fuel cycles are  \n\n   | Reaction | Symbolic form | Main products | Energy release* |\n   |----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|\n   | Deuterium – Tritium | \\( {\\rm D}+{\\rm T}\\rightarrow\\alpha+n \\) | \\(^4\\!{\\rm He}(3.5\\,{\\rm MeV})\\,+\\,n(14.1\\,{\\rm MeV})\\) | \\(Q\\simeq 17.6\\;\\text{MeV}\\) |\n   | Deuterium – Deuterium | Two branches <br>①\\( {\\rm D}+{\\rm D}\\rightarrow {}^{3}{\\rm He}+n \\)<br>②\\( {\\rm D}+{\\rm D}\\rightarrow {\\rm T}+p \\) | Branch ① : \\({}^{3}{\\rm He}(0.82\\,{\\rm MeV})+n(2.45\\,{\\rm MeV})\\) <br>Branch ② : \\({\\rm T}(1.01\\,{\\rm MeV})+p(3.02\\,{\\rm MeV})\\) | Average \\( Q\\approx 4\\;\\text{MeV}\\) per D‑D event |\n   | Deuterium – Helium‑3 | \\( {\\rm D}+{}^{3}{\\rm He}\\rightarrow\\alpha+p \\) | \\(\\alpha(3.6\\,{\\rm MeV})+p(14.7\\,{\\rm MeV})\\) | \\(Q\\simeq 18.3\\;\\text{MeV}\\) |\n\n   (*The quoted values are kinetic energies carried away by the outgoing particles.)\n\n2. **Which reaction has the largest fusion cross‑section?**  \n   Fusion reactivity depends strongly on the centre‑of‑mass collision energy. Experimental data show:\n\n   * D‑T: σ peaks at ≃ 5 barns when the CM energy is ≈ 64 keV (≈ 15 keV ion temperature).\n   * D‑³He: σ max ≈ 0.9 barn at ≈ 150 keV.\n   * D‑D: σ max ≈ 0.07 barn at ≈ 200 keV.\n\n   Hence **the deuterium‑tritium (D‑T) reaction possesses by far the highest cross‑section**, making it the easiest to ignite under realistic plasma conditions.\n\n3. **What becomes of the neutrons produced?**  \n\n   • **Energy deposition / heating:** The 14.1 MeV neutrons from D‑T carry ≈ 80 % of the total fusion energy. They escape the hot core, slow down in a surrounding *breeding/blanket* region (often Li‑containing liquid metal such as LiPb or solid Li₂TiO₃). Their kinetic energy is transferred to the bulk material, providing the primary source of thermal power that drives turbines.\n\n   • **Tritium breeding:** Fast neutrons react with lithium:\n   \\[\n     {}^{6}{\\rm Li}+n\\;\\to\\;{}^{4}{\\rm He}+{}^{3}{\\rm H}+4.78~\\text{MeV},\n   \\]\n   \\[\n     {}^{7}{\\rm Li}+n\\;(>\\!2.5~\\text{MeV})\\;\\to\\;{}^{4}{\\rm He}+{}^{3}{\\rm H}+n'+2.47~\\text{MeV}.\n   \\]\n   These reactions generate the tritium needed to sustain the D‑T cycle (“self‑sufficiency”).\n\n   • **Secondary uses:** High‑energy neutrons can be harvested for:\n      - Production of valuable radio‑isotopes (\\(^{99m}\\)Tc, \\(^{60}\\)Co) in dedicated target modules,\n      - Materials‑testing facilities (irradiation of steels, tungsten, SiC),\n      - Driving sub‑critical fission blankets (hybrid reactor concept).\n\n   • **Shielding & activation concerns:** Because the neutrons are uncharged, they penetrate walls and activate structural components.

For spherical (ε=0): B0 = αA - β A^(2/3) - γ Z^2 A^{-1/3}.

In typical nuclear bomb or reactor, not all atoms fission; but question likely wants total potential energy if fully fissioned. Energy per fission ~200 MeV = 3.2e-11 J. Number of atoms in 1g of U-235 (or natural Uranium). Use Avogadro's number NA=6.022e23 mol^-1. Molar mass approx 238 g/mol for U-238, but we can approximate with 235 g/mol. So N ≈ (1 g / 235 g/mol)*NA ≈ 0.004255 *6.022e23≈2.56e21 atoms. Multiply by 200 MeV each => E_fiss = 2.56e21*3.2e-11 J = about 8.19e10 J (~8×10^10 J).\n\nNow TNT: chemical explosive yields around 4.184 kJ/g (since 1 kilocalorie = 4.184 kJ, and TNT equivalent is defined as 4184 J/g?).

Total spin zero means singlet state; overall wavefunction = antisymmetric under particle exchange because electrons are fermions. The total wavefunction factorizes into spatial part times spin part. For total spin S=0 (singlet), the spin part is antisymmetric under exchange. Therefore the spatial part must be symmetric so that product gives overall antisymmetry.\n\nThe question asks about what happens when we interchange the spatial coordinates of two electrons in such a state. Since they ask specifically about swapping spatial coordinates while presumably leaving spins untouched? In a total spin-zero state, the spin part already accounts for antisymmetry. So exchanging only spatial coordinates will affect the spatial part which is symmetric => no change (unchanged). However note that full wavefunction includes both parts; if you swap entire particles including their spin labels, then whole wavefunction picks up minus sign due to fermionic nature. But here they say \"interchange the spatial coordinates\" meaning just positions r1 ↔ r2 but not spin states? Usually exchange operator swaps all degrees of freedom (coordinates + spin). If you keep spin fixed, you're effectively applying permutation on space only. Then since spatial part is symmetric, it remains same -> option (b).\n\nThus answer: (b) the wave function is unchanged.\n\nProvide reasoning and final box.\n\nLet's craft response with steps.assistantfinalFor identical fermions the **total** wave‑function must be antisymmetric under the complete exchange  \n\\[\nP_{12}\\,\\Psi(\\mathbf r_1,s_1;\\mathbf r_2,s_2)= -\\,\\Psi(\\mathbf r_1,s_1;\\mathbf r_2,s_2),\n\\]\nwhere \\(P_{12}\\) exchanges *all* variables of electron 1 with those of electron 2.\n\nWhen the pair of electrons forms a **spin–singlet** (\\(S=0\\)) state, its spin part,\n\\[\n\\chi_{\\text{singlet}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}\n\\bigl(|\\uparrow\\rangle_1|\\downarrow\\rangle_2-\n      |\\downarrow\\rangle_1|\\uparrow\\rangle_2\\bigr),\n\\]\nis itself **antisymmetric**:\n\\( P_{12}\\chi_{\\text{singlet}}=-\\chi_{\\text{singlet}}\\).\n\nConsequently the spatial part \\(\\Phi(\\mathbf r_1,\\mathbf r_2)\\) has to be **symmetric**\nso that the product \\(\\Psi=\\Phi\\,\\chi_{\\text{singlet}}\\) becomes overall antisymmetric:\n\\[\nP_{12}\\Phi(\\mathbf r_1,\\mathbf r_2)=+\\Phi(\\mathbf r_1,\\mathbf r_2).\n\\]\n\nNow the problem asks only for the effect of interchanging the **spatial coordinates**, i.e. applying \\(P_{12}\\) solely on \\(\\Phi\\) while keeping the spin functions unchanged.

So electric field inside uniformly charged sphere: E = (1/(4π ε0)) * (Q_enclosed / r^2?) Actually Gauss law gives E(r)= (ρ * r)/(3ε0) directed outward radially. Where ρ = total charge density = Ze / ((4/3) π a^3). Then magnitude of force F = - e * E (negative because electron negative charge experiences opposite direction). So F = - e * (ρ r /(3 ε0)). Plug ρ => Ze /((4/3)π a^3) = 3Ze/(4π a^3). Thus E = (ρ r)/(3 ε0) = [3Ze/(4π a^3)] * r / (3 ε0) = (Ze r)/(4π ε0 a^3). Direction radial outward.

So term A ∇² gives contribution -A * (π^2/L^2)*(sum n_i^2). Then total exponent coefficient = B - A*(π^2/L^2)*(N^2) where N^2=n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2. The mode with smallest decay (largest growth) corresponds to lowest eigenvalue magnitude i.e., n=m=p=1 => N^2=3. Thus effective growth rate σ = B - A* (π^2/L^2)*3 . If σ>0 then exponential increase -> instability. Critical when σ=0 → L_c = π sqrt(3A/B)? Wait solving B = 3 A π^2 / L_c^2 => L_c = π √(3A/B). Yes.\n\nPart (a): Explain diffusion term from random walk scattering causing net flux proportional to gradient leading to Fick's law; constant A related to diffusion coefficient D.

Their motion therefore looks like a random walk – a diffusive process. On macroscopic scales this is described by Fick’s law \\({\\bf J}= -D\\,\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\rho\\); inserting it into the continuity equation \\(\\partial_t\\rho+ \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\!\\cdot {\\bf J}=S\\) yields \\(\\partial_t\\rho=D\\nabla^2\\rho\\). Hence \\(A\\equiv D\\) is the **diffusion coefficient**, measuring how fast neutrons spread out. | Diffusion cannot create neutrons; it only transports them down their concentration gradient, thus the diffusivity \\(D=A\\) must be non‑negative. In ordinary matter \\(D>0\\) because any finite mean free path together with thermal velocities produces a spreading cloud. |\n|\\(B\\rho\\) | This represents the **net production** of neutrons by nuclear fission. Each neutron that slows down enough may induce a fission event, releasing on average \\(\\nu\\) new neutrons. Part of these newborn neutrons escape or get absorbed without causing another fission; the remainder contributes to a source term proportional to the local neutron density: \\(S_{\\text{fiss}}=\\beta\\rho\\). Writing \\(\\beta=B\\) we obtain the linear “reaction” term. | As long as the material contains fissile isotopes (\\(^{235}{\\rm U}\\)) and the neutrons have sufficient energy, a single neutron can lead to additional ones, so the net multiplication factor exceeds unity locally.

Since we didn't include ħ, but physical relationship: photon energy E_photon = ℏ ω_phys. Our variable ω above corresponds to photon energy divided by c? Let's check: With c=1, photon 4-vector (E, p)= (ℏ ω, ℏ ω) if using standard units with ℏ not set to 1. But we set ℏ=1 also implicitly because we treat energies directly. To get actual frequency f or angular freq, we note Δ is difference in mass (rest energy) i.e., Δ c^2? Actually problem says \"ground state of mass M and excited state of mass M+Δ\".

Give your reasoning.", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to analyze a \"helium-like\" system with nucleus (charge +2e) and two identical spin-1 particles each negatively charged (-e). They have no spin dependent interactions; i.e., Hamiltonian depends only on spatial coordinates, not spin.\n\nThus we treat them as bosons or fermions depending on total wavefunction symmetry requirement. Since they are identical spin-1 particles, their intrinsic spin is integer => they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. So overall wavefunction must be symmetric under particle exchange. The total wavefunction = spatial part * spin part. Because they're bosons, total must be symmetric. Spin states can be combined into various total spin S values from addition of two spin-1's: possible total spins S=0,1,2 (since adding two s=1 gives multiplets of dimension (2s+1)^2 =9 decomposes into irreps: symmetric triplet? Actually decomposition: 3⊗3 = 5 ⊕ 3 ⊕ 1 corresponding to S=2 (dim5), S=1 (dim3), S=0 (dim1). Symmetry properties: Under interchange of two identical bosons, the spin wavefunction has certain symmetry: For two spin-1 bosons, the total spin S=2 and S=0 correspond to symmetric spin functions? Let's recall: For two spin-½ fermions, singlet antisymmetric, triplet symmetric. In general, exchanging two identical particles flips sign according to whether representation is symmetric/antisymmetric. Decompose product representations: For SU(2), the symmetric subspace corresponds to even total spin when both individual spins are same? Wait: For two spin-s particles, the symmetric combination yields total spin J ranging from 2s down to either 0 or 1 depending parity? More concretely, symmetrization property: The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients show that the highest spin (J=2s) is fully symmetric. Then decreasing by steps of 2 produce symmetric spaces, while odd steps give antisymmetric? Example: Two spin-1/2 (s=1/2): allowed J=1 (triplet) symmetric, J=0 (singlet) antisymmetric. That's consistent: Highest J (=1) symmetric, lower J (=0) antisymmetric. For two spin-1 (s=1): Allowed J=2,1,0. I think J=2 symmetric, J=1 antisymmetric, J=0 symmetric again because pattern alternates. Indeed dimensions: symmetric subspace dimension = (n(n+1))/2 where n=2s+1=3 -> dim_sym =6 ; antisym = (n(n-1))/2 =3 . Total dims sum to 9. Which J multiplicities: J=2 (dim5) plus maybe some component of J=0 (dim1) make up 6 symmetric; J=1 (dim3) antisymmetric. That matches: symmetric includes J=2 (5) + one of J=0 (1)=6; antisymmetric is J=1 (3). Therefore spin symmetric states: S=2 (fivefold degenerate) and S=0 (onefold). Antisymmetric spin state: S=1 (threefold).\n\nNow spatial part must combine such that total wavefunction symmetric. If spin part symmetric → spatial part also symmetric. If spin part antisymmetric → spatial part antisymmetric.\n\nGround state energy will involve lowest orbital configuration respecting Pauli principle for bosons? But since they are bosons, there is no restriction except overall symmetry. Typically for helium with electrons (fermions), ground state is both occupy 1s orbital forming spatially symmetric (both in same orbital) but spin anti-symmetric (singlet). Here for bosonic spin-1 particles, they could both occupy the same spatial orbital (the 1s hydrogenic orbital) if the spatial part is symmetric (which it would be if both are in same single-particle state). This is allowed because bosons can share quantum numbers. Thus the lowest-energy spatial wavefunction is symmetric (product of two 1s orbitals). That is symmetric indeed. Hence spin part must also be symmetric to keep total symmetric (boson). So permissible spin configurations are those symmetric ones: total spin S=2 (multiplicity 5) and S=0 (multiplicity 1). Both yield same spatial energy (ground). Are these distinct eigenstates? Yes, different total spin leads to degeneracy due to spin degrees of freedom. Energy does not depend on spin (neglected spin-dependent forces). So all symmetric spin states are degenerate with same spatial energy. Number of symmetric spin states = 6.\n\nBut wait, could there be any other possibilities like having antisymmetric spatial part with higher orbital excitations leading to same total energy? No, excited spatial energies > ground so not relevant.\n\nTherefore ground-state degeneracy equals number of symmetric spin states = 6.\n\nCheck: Could the S=0 state be considered symmetric? Need confirm it's symmetric under exchange. For two spin-1, the singlet is constructed using Clebsch Gordan coefficient: |S=0,M=0> = (|1,-1>-|-1,1>) / sqrt(2)? Actually that's antisymmetric? Let's compute: For two spin-1, basis m1,m2 ∈{-1,0,+1}. Singlet combination is proportional to Σ_{m}(-1)^{1-m}|m,-m>. This may be antisymmetric? We should verify symmetry. Use permutation operator P12 acting swaps labels. For state |ψ_singlet>, swapping changes sign factor? Evaluate: P12|m,-m>= |-m,m>. Summation over m yields same terms but order reversed. Does that equal original? Might get sign (+?). Let's test explicit expression:\n\n|0,0> = (1/√3)(|1,-1> - |0,0> + |-1,1>). Hmm typical formula for coupling j=j' =1: Clebsh–Gordan coefficients: <1 m 1 -m|00> = (-1)^{1-m}/sqrt{3}. So |00> = (1/√3)[|1,-1> - |0,0> + |-1,1>].\n\nSwap indices: becomes (1/√3)[|-1,1> - |0,0> + |1,-1>] = same as original because ordering doesn't matter additive commutative.

Uniform sphere charge distribution gives self-energy:\n\nE = (3/5)*(Z^2 e^2)/(R)\n\nwhere R = r0 * A^(1/3), with r0 = 1.2e-13 cm = 1.2 fm.\n\nSo initial E_i = (3/5)(Z^2 e^2)/R_U.\n\nAfter split into two fragments each about half mass => A_f ≈ A/2 ~119, Z_f approx proportional -> Z_f ≈ Z/2 ≈46 (assuming symmetric fission). So each fragment has its own Coulomb energy: E_frag = (3/5)((Z/2)^2 e^2)/R_f where R_f = r0*(A/2)^{1/3}. Total after splitting: 2*E_frag.\n\nCompute ratio.\n\nLet’s write general expression.\n\nInitial: Ei ∝ Z^2 / A^{1/3}\n\nFinal total Ef = 2 * ((Z/2)^2) / ( (A/2)^{1/3}) = 2 * (Z^2/4) / (A^{1/3}/2^{1/3}) = (Z^2/2) * (2^{1/3}/A^{1/3}) = Z^2 * (2^{ -2 + 1/3}? Wait compute carefully.)\n\nLet's do algebra:\n\nEf = 2 * [(Z/2)^2] / [r0*(A/2)^{1/3}] times constant factor same as before.\n\nSimplify numerator: (Z^2/4); multiply by 2 → Z^2/2.\n\nDenominator scaling: (A/2)^{1/3}= A^{1/3} * 2^{-1/3}.\n\nThus Ef = (Z^2/2) / (A^{1/3} * 2^{-1/3}) = (Z^2/2) * (2^{1/3}/A^{1/3}) = Z^2 * (2^{1/3 -1}) / A^{1/3} = Z^2 * (2^{-2/3}) / A^{1/3} because 1/3 -1 = -2/3.\n\nIndeed 2^{1/3 -1}=2^{-2/3}.\n\nTherefore Ef/Ei = (Z^2 * 2^{-2/3} / A^{1/3}) / (Z^2/A^{1/3}) = 2^{-2/3} ≈ ?\n\n2^{-2/3} = (2^{2/3})^-1 . 2^{2/3}= (2^{1/3})^2 ≈ (1.26)^2 ≈1.587. Inverse ≈0.63.\n\nThus Coulomb energy reduces to about 0.63 of original, i.e., reduction ΔE_Coulomb = Ei - Ef = (1 - 0.63)=0.37 Ei (~37% decrease).\n\nNow calculate numeric value for Uranium.\n\nEi = (3/5)*(Z^2 e^2)/R.\n\nTake e^2 in MeV·fm units: e^2/(4π ε0) = α ħc ≈ 1.44 MeV·fm. But formula using Gaussian cgs maybe includes that directly: For uniformly charged sphere, potential energy = (3/5) (Z^2 e^2)/R where e^2 expressed in appropriate unit (MeV·fm). Use R in fm.\n\nFirst convert R_U: r0=1.2 fm, A=238 ⇒ A^{1/3}=238^{1/3}. Compute approximate cube root: 6^3=216, 6.2^3~238? Let's check 6.22^3=240.7 close. So A^{1/3}≈6.2. Then R_U =1.2*6.2=7.44 fm.\n\nThen Ei = (3/5)* (Z^2 * 1.44 MeV·fm ) / (7.44 fm) = (3/5)*(Z^2 *1.44 /7.44) MeV.\n\nCalculate coefficient: 1.44/7.44 =0.19355. Multiply by 3/5 =0.6. Actually 3/5=0.6. So overall factor =0.6*0.19355=0.11613.\n\nThus Ei ≈ 0.116 * Z^2 MeV. With Z=92, Z^2=8464. Multiply: 0.116*8464 ≈ 982 MeV. Roughly 1 GeV.\n\nCheck typical Coulomb barrier for heavy nuclei around 800 MeV, so plausible.\n\nNow reduction ΔE = 0.37*Ei ≈ 0.37*982 ≈ 363 MeV.\n\nAlternatively we can present analytic relation: Reduction fraction = 1 - 2^{-2/3} ≈ 0.37.\n\nTotal change in energy also involves surface tension etc. The question asks \"What is the relationship of this to the total change in energy?\" Probably meaning compare Coulomb reduction to total binding energy release from fission which is about 200 MeV per fission event. However our estimated reduction is larger than actual released kinetic energy due to other terms like increase in surface area raising surface energy offsetting some coulomb gain. Indeed net energy release ~200 MeV while Coulomb reduction alone would give ~360 MeV, but part goes into increased surface energy (+~180 MeV) leaving net ~200 MeV.\n\nThus relationship: Net energy change = ΔE_coulomb – ΔE_surface (and volume term unchanged). Using liquid drop model: Surface term scales as A^{2/3}, splitting doubles surfaces leading to increase ΔEsurf = a_s (2*A_f^{2/3} - A^{2/3}). Approx evaluate yields similar magnitude.\n\nBut perhaps they just want statement: reduction in electrostatic energy accounts for most of the total energy liberated (~80%). So answer: reduction ~350 MeV, which is comparable to total fission energy (~200 MeV) indicating other contributions reduce it.\n\nI'll craft final answer showing derivation and result.\n\nassistantfinalThe electro‑static (Coulomb) self–energy of a uniformly charged spherical nucleus of charge \\(Ze\\) and radius  \n\n\\[\nR=r_{0}\\,A^{1/3},\\qquad \nr_{0}=1.2\\times10^{-13}{\\rm cm}=1.2{\\rm \\,fm},\n\\]\n\nis  \n\n\\[\nE_{\\rm C}(A,Z)=\\frac{3}{5}\\,\\frac{Z^{2}e^{2}}{R}\n            =\\frac{3}{5}\\,\n              \\frac{Z^{2}e^{2}}\n                   {r_{0}A^{1/3}}\\ .\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Energy before fission  \n\nFor \\({}^{238}{\\rm U}\\;(Z=92,A=238)\\),\n\n\\[\nA^{1/3}\\simeq 238^{1/3}\\approx 6.20 ,\\qquad   \nR\\simeq 1.2\\,{\\rm fm}\\times6.20\\approx 7.44 {\\rm fm}.\n\\]\n\nUsing \\(e^{2}=1.44\\;\\mathrm{MeV\\! \\cdot\\! fm}\\),\n\n\\[\nE_{\\rm C}^{(i)}=\n\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{(92)^{2}\\,(1.44\\;{\\rm MeV\\!\\cdot\\! fm})}{7.44\\;{\\rm fm}}\n      \\approx 9.8\\times10^{2}\\;{\\rm MeV}\\;(\\sim 1\\;{\\rm GeV}).\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Energy after symmetric binary fission  \n\nEach fragment contains approximately one half of the nucleons:\n\\(A' = A/2\\)   and   \\(Z' = Z/2\\).\n\nIts Coulomb energy is  \n\n\\[\nE_{\\rm C}'=\\frac{3}{5}\\,\n           \\frac{(Z/2)^{2}e^{2}}\n                {r_{0}(A/2)^{1/3}} .\n\\]\n\nBecause there are **two** identical fragments,\n\n\\[\nE_{\\rm C}^{(f)} = 2E_{\\rm C}'\n                 =\\frac{3}{5}\\,\n                  \\frac{Z^{2}e^{2}}\n                       {r_{0}A^{1/3}}\\;\n                    2^{-2/3}\n                 =E_{\\rm C}^{(i)}\\;2^{-2/3}.\n\\tag{3}\n\\]\n\nSince   \n\n\\[\n2^{-2/3}= \\frac{1}{2^{2/3}}\\simeq\\frac{1}{1.59}\\approx 0.63 ,\n\\]\n\nthe total Coulomb energy after fission is only about 63 % of the original value.\n\nHence the **reduction** in electrostatic energy is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Delta E_{\\rm C}=E_{\\rm C}^{(i)}-E_{\\rm C}^{(f)}\n       =(1-2^{-2/3})E_{\\rm C}^{(i)}\n       \\simeq 0.37\\,E_{\\rm C}^{(i)}} .\n\\]\n\nNumerically for \\({}^{238}{\\rm U}\\),\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_{\\rm C}\\approx 0.37\\times 9.8\\times10^{2}\\;{\\rm MeV}\n               \\approx 3.6\\times10^{2}\\;{\\rm MeV}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Relation to the total energy released in fission  \n\nIn the liquid‑drop picture the total change in binding energy on going from one heavy nucleus to two lighter ones is  \n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_{\\rm tot}= \\underbrace{\\Delta E_{\\rm C}}_{\\displaystyle\\text{gain}}\n                     +\\underbrace{\\Delta E_{\\rm surf}}_{\\displaystyle\\text{loss}}\n                     +\\underbrace{\\Delta E_{\\rm vol}}_{=0}+...\n\\]\n\nSplitting creates extra surface area, increasing the surface term  \n\\(\\Delta E_{\\rm surf}\\approx+1.8\\times10^{2}\\;{\\rm MeV}\\).  \nConsequently the **net** energy made available as kinetic energy of the fragments is  \n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_{\\rm net}\\;\\approx\\;\\Delta E_{\\rm C}-|\\Delta E_{\\rm surf}|\n                         \\;\\approx\\;360\\;{\\rm MeV}-180\\;{\\rm MeV}\n                         \\;\\approx\\;180\\mbox{--}200\\;{\\rm MeV},\n\\]\n\nwhich agrees with the observed average fission energy (\\(\\sim 200\\) MeV).\n\nThus the Coulomb‐energy reduction supplies roughly three‑quarters of the total energy budget, the remainder being cancelled by the rise in surface energy.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\Delta E_{\\rm C}\\;\\approx\\;3.6\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}\\\\[2mm]\n&(1-\\!2^{-2/3})\\;E_{\\rm C}^{(i)}\\;\\approx\\;0.37\\,E_{\\rm C}^{(i)},\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{Net fission energy } \\sim 200\\ {\\rm MeV}.\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\]"}

For a very heavy nucleus the attractive terms dominate only up to a certain size; beyond it the Coulomb term grows faster than the surface term.\n\n* **Saddle point (\\(R=R_{\\text{saddle}}\\)):**   \n  As the shape elongates, the surface area increases → larger surface‑term penalty, while the charge distribution becomes more elongated → smaller Coulomb self‑energy. Their competition creates a maximum in \\(E(R)\\); this is the *fission barrier*. In the liquid‑drop picture it corresponds to the most deformed configuration before the neck ruptures.\n\n* **Scission region (\\(R\\simeq R_{\\text{scission}}\\)):**    \n  When the neck finally breaks the two fragments separate. Each fragment now has its own surface and Coulomb energies. Because each piece has a much smaller charge, the net Coulomb repulsion drops sharply, whereas the sum of the new surfaces adds only modestly to the total energy. Consequently the curve falls steeply after the saddle point.\n\n* **Asymptotic limit (\\(R\\rightarrow\\infty\\)):**     \n  Two isolated daughter nuclei sit far apart; the total energy equals the sum of their individual binding energies plus essentially zero interaction between them.

By dividing the big nucleus into two pieces the total Coulomb repulsion decreases dramatically (each fragment carries roughly half the charge), while the increase in total surface area is comparatively small. Hence the summed binding energy of the products exceeds that of the parent, releasing typically \\(~200\\;\\text{MeV}\\) per fission event.\n\nQuantum mechanically, part of the Q‑value appears as kinetic energy of the recoiling fragments, and the remainder excites prompt neutrons, γ‑rays, β‑decay chains, etc.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Why mid‑mass nuclei (Fe → Pb) do not fission spontaneously**\n\nTwo complementary reasons prevent ordinary isotopes in the range \\(56<Z<82\\) from undergoing spontaneous fission:\n\n| Reason | Explanation |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Binding‑energy trend** | Nuclei around iron have the **maximum binding energy per nucleon** (~8.8 MeV). Splitting any nucleus whose average binding per nucleon is already close to this maximum would *decrease* the total binding, i.e. cost energy rather than release it. Only when the Coulomb repulsion becomes comparable to—or outweighs—the surface term (roughly for \\(Z\\gtrsim90\\)) does division become energetically favorable. |\n| **Fission barrier height** | Even if a split were slightly exothermic, the liquid‑drop model predicts a substantial **fission barrier** arising from the required deformation. For midsized nuclei the barrier height \\(B_f\\) is on the order of tens of MeV, vastly exceeding typical thermal excitations (< kT ≈ 25 meV) and even the zero‑point vibrational energy. Quantum tunnelling through such a wide, tall barrier gives astronomically long lifetimes (≫ age of the universe). |\n\nConsequently, without external stimulation (e.g., neutron capture that supplies ~6–7 MeV of excitation energy) these nuclei remain stable against spontaneous binary fission.\n\n---  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\; \\text{Energy‑vs‑separation curve shows a local minimum (parent),}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{saddle (fission barrier) and a deeper minimum at }R\\!\\to\\!\\infty\\\\\n&\\text{(b)}\\; Q=\\sum B_\\text{daughters}-B_\\text{parent},\\;\n\\text{mainly from reduction of Coulomb repulsion}.\\\\\n&\\text{(c)}\\; Mid‑range nuclei lack sufficient Coulomb drive and face a high }\n\\\\ &\\qquad\\text{liquid‑drop fission barrier ⇒ negligible spontaneous fission rate.}\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\]"}

Thus σ≈4πC *525.5.\n\nRecall C = (Zz e² / (4K))^2 = earlier computed value before angular factor i.e., 5.49e-28 cm² (since that's C without csc^4?). Indeed our previous calculation gave C =5.49e-28 cm² (that's the prefactor). Good.\n\nNow compute: 4π*C =4*3.1416*5.49e-28 =12.566*5.49e-28 =6.90e-27 cm².\n\nMultiply by 525.5 => σ_total ≈ 6.90e-27 *525.5 = 3.63e-24 cm².\n\nThus integrated cross-section for θ>5° about 3.6×10⁻24 cm².\n\nPart e: Rate = Ndot * nL * σ_integrated.\n\nnL same 6.022e20 atoms/cm².\n\nRate =1e12 *6.022e20 *3.63e-24 =1e12 * (6.022e20 *3.63e-24) =1e12 * (6.022*3.63 e(-4)) =1e12 * (21.86e-4) =1e12 *2.186e-3 =2.19e9 ? wait check exponent: 6.022e20 *3.63e-24 = (6.022*3.63) e(-4) =21.86e-4 =2.186e-3. Yes dimensionless probability per proton. Times 1e12 yields 2.186e9 protons/sec scattered beyond 5 degrees.\n\nSeems huge compared to initial beam intensity; but note thin foil may cause many small-angle scatterings; however Rutherford diverges strongly at small angles leading to high probability. Might be unrealistic because screening cuts off divergence; still follow math.\n\nThus answer ~2×10⁹ s⁻¹.\n\nPart f: Multiple Coulomb scattering RMS angle (projected) approximated by Highland formula:\n\nθ₀ = (13.6 MeV)/(β pc) √(t/X₀)[1+0.038 ln(t/X₀)]\n\nGiven constant 15 MeV/c (maybe they want θ_rms = (constant/p)√(t/x0)). They said \"Take the constant in the expression for multiple Coulomb scattering as 15 MeV/c.\" Likely formula: θ₀ = (15 MeV/c) / p * √(t / X₀ ), where t is thickness in g/cm², X₀ radiation length in g/cm².\n\nOur window: thickness 0.01 cm, density 2.7 g/cm³ => t_mass = 0.027 g/cm².\n\nX₀ = 24 g/cm².\n\nRatio t/X₀ =0.027/24 =0.001125.\n\nsqrt =0.03354.\n\nMomentum p =200 MeV/c.\n\nThus θ₀ = (15 MeV/c)/200 MeV/c *0.03354 = (0.075) *0.03354 =0.002515 rad ≈ 2.5 mrad.\n\nProjected rms angle = θ₀/√2 perhaps? Usually projected (one plane) is θ₀/√2. If they ask projected rms, divide by √2: 0.00252/1.414 =0.00178 rad =1.8 mrad.\n\nProvide both if needed.\n\nNow craft final answer with each part.\n\nNeed box latex for final answers?

What is the ratio of the wavelengths of the He and H radiation?\n\n(c) Why is it difficult to observe this transition in laboratory experiment?", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to compute frequencies/wavelengths using Rydberg formula with reduced mass correction perhaps. For high n (Rydberg states), energy difference approximated via Bohr formula:\n\nE_n = -Ry * μ/m_e / n^2 where Ry=13.6057 eV for infinite nuclear mass; but actual value includes reduced mass factor: Ry' = Ry * μ/(m_e). For hydrogen nucleus proton mass m_p ≈1836 m_e => μ≈(m_em_p)/(m_e+m_p)= m_e*1836/1837 ≈0.99946 m_e so reduction ~0.00054% effect negligible. So we can use standard values.\n\nEnergy difference ΔE = E_{108} - E_{109}. Since energies negative magnitude decreasing as n increases, emission corresponds to lower absolute energy (more bound): ΔE = Ry*(1/108^2 - 1/109^2).\n\nCompute numeric.\n\nFirst calculate 1/n^2 differences.\n\nLet’s do approximate calculation.\n\n1/108^2 = 1/11664 ≈8.573e-5 (since 1/10000=1e-4, adjust). Compute precisely: Use calculator mental: 1/11664 = ?\n\nTake reciprocal: 11664 -> maybe easier compute difference directly.\n\nΔ = 1/108^2 - 1/109^2 = (109^2 - 108^2)/(108^2 * 109^2)\n\nNow numerator: 109^2 - 108^2 = (109-108)(109+108)=1*217=217.\n\nDenominator: (108*109)^2 . Actually product squared: (108^2)*(109^2) = (108*109)^2.\n\nSo denominator = (11772)^2 because 108*109 = 11772. Square that: 11772^2 approx (1.1772e4)^2 = 1.386...e8. Let's compute more accurately: 11772^2 = (11770+2)^2 = 11770^2 + 2*11770*2 +4 = (138, ... let's compute) 11770^2 = (1177*10)^2 = 1177^2 *100 = ? 1177^2 = (1200-23)^2 = 1440000 - 55200 +529 = 138,?? Wait compute exactly: 1200^2=1,440,000 ; minus 2*1200*23=55,200 gives 1,384,800 ; plus 23^2=529 yields 1,385,329. Multiply by 100 → 138,532,900. Then add cross term: 2*11770*2 = 47,080 ; plus 4 = total 138,580, - wait sum: 138,532,900 + 47,080 = 138,579,980 ; +4 = 138,579,984. Good.\n\nThus denominator = 138,579,984.\n\nTherefore Δ = 217 / 138,579,984 ≈ 1.566×10^{-6}.\n\nCheck: 217/1.3858e8 = about 1.5659e-6.\n\nMultiply by Ry constant in joules: Ry = hcR∞ = 13.605693009 eV = convert to J: multiply by 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ⇒ 2.179872361e-18 J.\n\nThen ΔE = Ry * Δ = 2.17987e-18 * 1.5659e-6 = 3.412e-24 J.\n\nFrequency ν = ΔE/h, h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s. So ν = 3.412e-24 / 6.62607e-34 = 5.149e9 Hz (~5.15 GHz). Wavelength λ = c/ν = 299792458 / 5.149e9 = 58.25 meters? Let's compute: 3e8 /5.15e9 = 0.0583 m = 5.83 cm? Wait check units: 3e8/5e9 = 0.06 m = 6 cm. Yes around 5.8 cm. Indeed typical hydrogen recombination lines near 5 cm region used in radio astronomy.\n\nLet's refine numbers: Using exact constants may give slightly different.\n\nCalculate ν more precisely: Δ = 217 / 138,579,984 = 1.565997e-6.\n\nΔE = 2.179872361e-18 * 1.565997e-6 = 3.41303e-24 J.\n\nDivide by h: 3.41303e-24 / 6.62607015e-34 = 5.15073e9 s^-1.\n\nλ = c/ν = 299792458 / 5.15073e9 = 0.058221 m = 5.8221 cm.\n\nGood.\n\nPart b: Helium atom (He+) singly ionized helium? Or neutral helium excited state? Usually \"excited helium atoms\" meaning He I (neutral) have similar series but due to Z=2 effective nuclear charge leads to scaling of Rydberg constant by Z_eff^2? For hydrogenic ions like He+, energy levels scale as Z^2 times hydrogen's (with reduced mass corrections). However they said \"same transition observed in excited helium atoms\". Could refer to He II (once-ionized helium) which behaves hydrogen-like with Z=2. If it's neutral helium, not hydrogenic, but there exist triplet/singlet series etc. But likely they mean He+ (hydrogenlike). Ratio of wavelengths λ_He / λ_H = (Z_H/Z_He)^2 ??? Let's derive.\n\nFor hydrogenic ion, wavenumber (inverse wavelength) given by R_Z * (1/n_low^2 - 1/n_high^2) where R_Z = R_inf * μ_r/M_e * Z^2. Thus λ ∝ 1/R_Z. Therefore λ scales inversely with Z^2 (assuming same reduced-mass factor close). Hence λ_He+/λ_H = 1/ Z^2 = 1/4. That would make helium line four times shorter wavelength (higher frequency). Check if that's consistent with observations: Hydrogen line at 5.82 cm, helium line should be ~1.455 cm. That's plausible.\n\nBut question asks ratio of wavelengths of He and H radiation. Likely λ_He / λ_H = 1/4.\n\nIf they consider neutral helium, then screening reduces effective Z~1, giving nearly same wavelength, not interesting. So they'd ask ratio expecting simple Z^2 scaling.\n\nThus answer: λ_He : λ_H = 1:4 or λ_He / λ_H = 1/4.\n\nAlternatively could present as λ_He = λ_H /4.\n\nc) Difficulty observing in lab: Because these are very low-energy transitions between highly-excited Rydberg states (small energy spacing ~ few µeV corresponding to microwave/radio frequencies). Populating such high-n states requires extremely low pressures and long lifetimes; collisions cause de-excitation before photon emission; detection of weak radio-frequency photons against background noise is hard; also required to maintain population inversion; natural linewidth small leading to Doppler broadening dominates; instrumentation limited. In labs you need huge cavities/resonators, cryogenic detectors, etc., while astronomical sources contain vast amounts of gas producing detectable signals.\n\nProvide explanation accordingly.\n\nNow craft final answer with LaTeX boxed result.\n\nNeed separate parts.\n\nWill include formulas steps.\n\nProceed.assistantfinal**Hydrogen‑like atom**\n\nThe non–relativistic Bohr‐energy levels (including the reduced‑mass correction) are  \n\n\\[\nE_{n}= -\\,R_{\\infty}\\,\\frac{\\mu}{m_{e}}\\;\\frac{1}{n^{2}},\\qquad \nR_{\\infty}=hcR_\\infty = 2.179 872 \\times10^{-18}\\ {\\rm J},\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\displaystyle \\frac{\\mu}{m_{e}}=\\frac{m_pm_e}{m_p+m_e}\\approx 0.999\\,464\\)\nfor ordinary hydrogen (\\(p\\)).  \nBecause the reduced‑mass factor differs from unity only by \\(5\\times10^{-4}\\%\\),\nit will be omitted in the numerical work – its influence on the answers is far below the quoted precision.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### (a) Frequency and wavelength of the \\(n=109\\rightarrow n=108\\) line\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E =E_{108}-E_{109}\n          =R_{\\infty}\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{108^{2}}-\\frac{1}{109^{2}}\\Bigr).\n\\]\n\nUsing   \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{108^{2}}-\\frac{1}{109^{2}}\n   =\\frac{109^{2}-108^{2}}{(108\\cdot109)^{2}}\n   =\\frac{217}{(108\\!\\times\\!109)^{2}}\n   =\\frac{217}{1.38579984\\times10^{8}}\n   =1.56599\\times10^{-6},\n\\]\n\nwe obtain  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\n\\Delta E = 2.17987236\\times10^{-18}\\ {\\rm J}\\,\n           (1.56599\\times10^{-6})\n         = 3.41\\times10^{-24}\\ {\\rm J}.\n\\;}\n\\]\n\nThe associated frequency and wavelength follow from \\(\\nu=\\Delta E/h\\) and \\(\\lambda=c/\\nu\\):\n\n\\[\n\\nu =\\frac{3.41\\times10^{-24}}{{6.62607015\\times10^{-34}}}\n     = 5.151\\times10^{9}\\ {\\rm s^{-1}},\n\\qquad\n\\lambda =\\frac{c}{\\nu}\n        =\\frac{2.99792458\\times10^{8}}{5.151\\times10^{9}}\n        =5.822\\times10^{-2}\\ {\\rm m}=5.82\\ {\\rm cm}.\n\\]\n\nHence  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\n\\nu = 5.15\\ {\\rm GHz},\\qquad   \n\\lambda = 5.82\\ {\\rm cm}.\n\\;}\n\\]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### (b) Same transition in helium\n\nA once‑ionised helium atom (He\\(^{+}\\)) is a **hydrogen‑like** system with nuclear charge \\(Z=2\\).  \nIts Rydberg constant is multiplied by \\(Z^{2}\\),\n\n\\[\nR_{\\text{He}^{+}} = Z^{2}R_{\\infty}=4R_{\\infty},\n\\]\n\nso all spectral intervals scale as \\(Z^{2}\\).

Assuming same coupling constant and similar matrix element; difference due to phase space factor ~ (ΔE)^5? For allowed semileptonic decays, width ∝ G_F^2 * |M|^2 * f(Q), where Q = mass difference - lepton masses etc. Approximate using Fermi's Golden rule with five-body phase space integral scaling as Q^5 (for three-body decay with leptons approximated massless). So ratio Γ(Σ→Λeν)/Γ(n→pe ν)= (Q_Σ / Q_n )^5 . Also maybe include small corrections from hadronic form factors but assume equal.\n\nCompute Q values: For n → p + e− + anti-nu : Δ = m_n - m_p ≈ 1.293 MeV. Subtract electron mass 0.511 => available kinetic energy shared among e and neutrino: Actually total Q = m_n - m_p - m_e ≈ 1.293 - 0.511 = 0.782 MeV. That's typical endpoint energy (~0.78 MeV).\n\nFor Σ⁻ → Λ + e⁻ + anti-ν: Δ = m_Sigma - m_Lambda = 1197.35 - 1116.058 = 81.292 MeV. subtract electron mass gives Q≈80.78 MeV.\n\nThus ratio Q_Σ/Q_n ≈ 80.8/0.782 ≈ 103.3.\n\nThen ratio of widths ≈ (103.3)^5 ≈ let's compute log10: log10(103.3)=2.014...

Sigma minus has quark content sdd? Actually Σ⁻ (dds) decays via s → u transition? Wait Σ⁻ (d ds?) No Σ⁻ composition: dds (two down, one strange). Lambda (uds). The weak change is s → u while spectator d,d remain. Neutron decay involves d → u. Same Cabibbo angle suppression? In strangeness-changing transitions there is Cabibbo suppressed amplitude V_us vs V_ud. But problem says \"same basic weak interaction\" perhaps ignoring CKM differences or assuming they are comparable magnitude? Might incorporate factor sinθ_C ≈ 0.22 leading to additional suppression squared ~0.05. That would increase lifetime by factor ~20. Could mention.\n\nSo estimated decay rate Γ ≈ (Q_Σ/Q_n)^5 * Γ_n ≈ 1×10^{10} * (1/τ_n). Since Γ_n = ħ/τ_n? Usually rate λ = 1/τ. So λ_Σ ≈ 1.2×10^{10} / (10^3 s) = 1.2×10^7 s^{-1}.

Need to determine correctness.\n\nLet's recall properties:\n\nTwo-body elastic scattering in CM frame: momentum vectors before and after have equal magnitude; they define a plane because initial momenta are opposite directions along some line; after scattering each outgoing momentum lies also in that plane due to conservation of total angular momentum vector being zero initially (if no external torques). In CM, initial relative motion defines axis; but if there is any impact parameter leading to orbital angular momentum L perpendicular to plane defined by incoming direction and impact parameter. However with only two particles, the reaction occurs such that all three vectors (initial p1, final p1', etc.) lie in one plane – yes generally scattering takes place in a single plane determined by initial relative velocity and impact parameter. So statement (a): \"All the particle trajectories must lie in the same plane in the centre-of-mass frame.\" True.\n\nNow (b): Helicity = projection of spin onto momentum direction. For massive particles, helicity can flip under parity or interactions unless conserved. In elastic scattering without external fields, helicity not necessarily conserved; it depends on interaction type. If forces are central (spherical symmetry) then spin-orbit coupling may cause flips? Actually for scalar potential, spin does not interact so helicity remains unchanged because spin orientation stays fixed while momentum changes direction => helicity could change sign depending on angle between spin and new momentum. But if spin doesn't couple, its spatial components remain constant in lab inertial frame, thus helicity might change as momentum rotates relative to spin. Therefore helicity is NOT generally conserved. Only for massless particles where chirality equals helicity and Lorentz invariance ensures helicity conservation in free propagation, but during scattering helicity can still flip via chiral couplings. So statement likely false.\n\nThus (b) false.\n\n(c): Angular distribution spherical symmetry means isotropic scattering independent of angles. That's only true for s-wave dominance low energies or when interaction has no preferred direction e.g., identical pointlike hard spheres? Generally differential cross-section depends on scattering amplitude which varies with angle. Not always spherically symmetric.

Conservation of total angular momentum therefore requires that the initial relative‐motion vector and the final relative‑momentum vector stay within a common plane. Hence every trajectory indeed lies in a single plane. → **True**.\n\n* **Statement (b)** – *“The helicity of a participant cannot change.”*  \n\n  Helicity is the projection of a particle’s spin on its instantaneous momentum direction. During an elastic scatter the momentum direction usually changes, whereas the spin vector (for a purely central force) does not follow it. Consequently the projection—i.e. the helicity—can change. There is no general dynamical principle forbidding helicity reversal except in special cases (e.g. massless particles interacting through strictly chiral couplings). → **False**.\n\n* **Statement (c)** – *“The angular distribution is always spherically symmetric.”*  \n\n  Anelastic scattering amplitudes depend on the details of the interaction potential. Except for very particular potentials (purely isotropic $s$‑wave scattering at ultra‑low energy) the differential cross section $\\mathrm d\\sigma/\\mathrm d\\Omega$ exhibits a non‑trivial dependence on the polar and azimuthal angles.

Compute numbers.\n\nFirst compute M_sum = m_K + m_Λ = 494 + 1116 = 1610 MeV.\n\nSquare: 1610^2 = (1.61e3)^2 = 2.5921e6 MeV^2.\n\nm_p^2 = 938.272^2 ~ let's calculate: 938.27^2 approx 880,000? Actually 940^2=883600; more precisely 938.272*938.272 = ?\n\nCompute: 938.272 * 938.272:\n938.272*900≈844444.8,\nplus 938.272*38.272≈938.272*40 -938.272*1.728 ≈37530.9 -1621.7≈35909.2.\nSum about 880354. So around 880k MeV^2.\n\nNow numerator: 2,592,100 - 880,350 ≈ 1,711,750 MeV^2.\n\nDivide by 2*m_p = 2*938.272 = 1876.544 MeV.\n\nEγ_th ≈ 1,711,750 / 1876.54 ≈ 912.5 MeV.\n\nLet's do precise division: 1,711,750/1876.5 ≈ 913 MeV.\n\nSo min gamma energy ~ 910 MeV.\n\nCheck typical thresholds: For kaon production on nucleon, threshold ~911 MeV indeed.\n\nTherefore answer (a): ~ 910 MeV.\n\nPart (b): With Fermi motion, effective initial proton may have some momentum opposite to photon reducing required photon energy. Suppose typical Fermi momentum k_F ~ 200 MeV/c (for nuclear interior). Choose maybe up to 250 MeV/c. We'll assume magnitude p_f = 200 MeV/c directed opposite photon beam (so reduces center-of-mass energy needed). Need compute minimal photon energy given moving target.\n\nGeneral formula: In lab where photon moves along +z, proton has momentum vector p_i (maybe negative z). Photon four-vector: (Eγ, 0,0,Eγ). Proton four-vector: (E_p , 0,0,-p_f ) if opposite direction. Where E_p = sqrt(p_f^2 + m_p^2 ).\n\nThen s = (p_γ + p_p)^2 = m_p^2 + 2(E_γ E_p + p_f E_γ cosθ?) Wait dot product: p_γ·p_p = E_γ E_p - |k|·p_vec = E_γ E_p - E_γ (-p_f) because photon momentum magnitude = E_γ (c=1), direction opposite so cosπ=-1 gives minus sign times -p_f -> plus? Let's write: photon three-momentum = (+Eγ) ẑ ; proton momentum = -p_f ẑ . Then scalar product of spatial parts: **k**·**p** = (+Eγ)(-p_f) = -Eγ p_f . Thus Minkowski inner product: p_γ·p_p = Eγ Ep - (**k**·**p**) = Eγ Ep -(-Eγ p_f) = Eγ(Ep + p_f). Good.\n\nHence s = m_p^2 + 2 p_γ·p_p = m_p^2 + 2 Eγ (Ep + p_f).\n\nThreshold condition same: s >= (Msum)^2.\n\nSolve for Eγ_min = [ (Msum)^2 - m_p^2 ] / [ 2 (Ep + p_f) ].\n\nSince denominator larger than 2 m_p (when p_f>0 ), Eγ decreases.\n\nPlug values: choose p_f = 200 MeV/c. Then Ep = sqrt(m_p^2 + p_f^2) = sqrt(938.272^2 + 200^2) ≈ sqrt(880,350 + 40,000) = sqrt(920,350) ≈ 959.35 MeV.\n\nEp + p_f = 959.35 + 200 =1159.35 MeV.\n\nDenominator 2*(1159.35) =2318.70 MeV.\n\nNumerator as before 1,711,750 MeV^2.\n\nThus Eγ_min ≈ 1,711,750 / 2318.7 ≈ 738 MeV.\n\nIf use p_f=250 MeV: Ep=sqrt(880,350+62,500)=sqrt(942,850)=971.07 MeV. Sum=1221.07 MeV. Denom=2442.14 MeV. Energy=1,711,750/2442.14≈701 MeV.\n\nThus range roughly 700–740 MeV depending on assumed Fermi momentum. Provide estimate using typical average Fermi momentum ~220 MeV leading to perhaps 720 MeV.\n\nWe'll present result: assuming p_F~200 MeV/c opposite photon yields Eγ,min≈740 MeV.\n\nPart (c):\n\nDecay Λ→ p + π− . Rest-frame decay momenta determined by two-body kinematics.\n\nIn Λ rest frame, magnitudes equal: p* = λ^{1/2}(m_Λ^2,m_p^2,m_π^2)/(2 m_Λ)\n\nwhere λ(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+z^2-2xy-2xz-2yz.\n\nCalculate.\n\nm_Λ=1116 MeV, m_p=938.272 MeV, m_π=139.57 MeV (~140). Use these.\n\nCompute squares:\n\nm_Λ^2 = 1116^2 = 1,245,456.\n\nm_p^2 = 938.272^2 ≈ 880,350.\n\nm_π^2 = 140^2 =19,600.\n\nNow lambda = m_Λ^4 + m_p^4 + m_π^4 -2 m_Λ^2 m_p^2 -2 m_Λ^2 m_π^2 -2 m_p^2 m_π^2 ??? Wait expression uses x=m_Λ^2 etc. Simpler compute via standard formula for daughter momentum:\n\np* = ((m_Λ^2-(m_p+m_π)^2)*(m_Λ^2-(m_p-m_π)^2))^(1/2) /(2 m_Λ).\n\nCompute sums/differences:\n\nm_p + m_π = 938.272+140 =1078.272 MeV.\n\n(m_p+m_π)^2 ≈ 1078.272^2. Approx: 1080^2=1,166,400; adjust down slightly: difference -? Let's compute accurately: 1078.272^2 = (1078)^2 + ... easier approximate: 1078.272*1078.272.\n\nBut we can compute numerically later.\n\nSimilarly m_p - m_π = 798.272 MeV. Square ~637,236.\n\nNow m_Λ^2 -(m_p+m_π)^2 = 1,245,456 - (approx 1,163,??). Let's compute exact.\n\nCompute (1078.272)^2:\n\n1078.272*1078.272.\n\nUse (1078)^2=1,162,084. Add corrections: 0.272 extra both sides.\n\nBetter method: (A+B)^2 = A^2 +2AB + B^2.\n\nLet A=1078, B=0.272.\n\nA^2=1,162,084.\n\n2AB=2*1078*0.272=2156*0.272=586.432.\n\nB^2=0.074.\n\nTotal=1,162,670.506 ≈1,162,671 MeV^2.\n\nOk.\n\nNext (m_p - m_π)= 938.272-140=798.272.\n\nSquare similarly: A=798,B=0.272.\n\nA^2=636,804.\n\n2AB=2*798*0.272=1596*0.272=434.112.\n\nB^2=0.074.\n\nTotal=637,238.186 ≈637,238 MeV^2.\n\nNow compute differences:\n\nΔ1 = m_Λ^2 - (m_p+m_π)^2 = 1,245,456 - 1,162,671 = 82,785 MeV^2.\n\nΔ2 = m_Λ^2 - (m_p - m_π)^2 = 1,245,456 - 637,238 = 608,218 MeV^2.\n\nProduct Δ1*Δ2 = 82,785 * 608,218 ≈?\n\nCompute: 82,785 * 608,218.\n\n80,000*608,218=48,657,440,000\n2,785*608,218 ≈ 2,785*600,000=1,671,000,000 plus 2,785*8,218≈22,876,? compute exactly: 2,785*8,218 = 2,785*8000=22,280,000; plus 2,785*218=607,? actually 2,785*200=557,000; *18=50,130; total 607,130. Summation: 22,280,000+607,130=22,887,130.\n\nAdd to previous 1,671,000,000 => 1,693,887,130.\n\nAdd to base 48,657,440,000 => 50,351,327,130.\n\nThus product ≈5.035×10¹⁰ MeV⁴.\n\nTake sqrt: sqrt(5.035e10) ≈ 224,380 MeV²? Wait sqrt units MeV^2. Since (MeV^2)^2 = MeV^4, sqrt returns MeV^2. But we want sqrt(product) which will be MeV^2. Let's compute sqrt.\n\nApproximate: sqrt(5.04e10) = sqrt(5.04)*1e5 = 2.247... *1e5 = 224,700 MeV^2.\n\nOur earlier guess similar.\n\nNow divide by (2 m_Λ) = 2*1116 =2232 MeV.\n\nThus p* ≈ 224,700 / 2232 ≈ 100.7 MeV/c.\n\nSo pion momentum in Lambda rest frame ~101 MeV/c.\n\nCorresponding energies: E*_π = sqrt(p*^2 + m_π^2) ≈ sqrt((101)^2 + 140^2) = sqrt(10201 +19600) = sqrt(29801) ≈172.6 MeV.\n\nNow consider Lambda moving with β = v/c =0.8, γ = 1/sqrt(1-β^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.64)=1/sqrt(0.36)=1/0.6=1.6667.\n\nLab frame: boost along z-direction (direction of Lambda's motion). Pion emitted at angle θ* in Lambda rest frame w.r.t. boost axis. Its lab momentum components:\n\nParallel component: p_parallel_lab = γ (p_* cosθ* + β E_* )\nPerpendicular component unchanged: p_perp_lab = p_* sinθ*\n\nMagnitude: p_lab^2 = p_perp^2 + p_par^2.\n\nMaximum possible lab momentum occurs when emission forward (cosθ*=1) giving largest parallel addition. Also transverse unaffected but could increase overall magnitude? Usually max magnitude when cosθ*=1 (forward). Because adding positive term increases parallel component while also having maximal projection onto direction.\n\nThus p_max = γ (p_* + β E_* ). Plug numbers:\n\np_* = 101 MeV/c, E_* = 173 MeV, β=0.8, γ=1.667.\n\nCompute inside parentheses: p_* + β E_* = 101 + 0.8*173 = 101 +138.4 =239.4 MeV.\n\nMultiply by γ: 1.667*239.4 ≈ 399.0 MeV/c.\n\nThus maximum pi momentum ≈ 400 MeV/c.\n\n(ii) Maximum component perpendicular to Lambda direction corresponds to choosing emission orthogonal to boost (θ* =90°). Then p_parallel_lab = γ (β E_* ) since cosθ*=0. Perpendicular component remains p_*.\n\nBut they ask \"maximum component of laboratory momentum perpendicular to the Λ0 direction\". That would be achieved when emission at right angles in Lambda rest frame? However due to Lorentz transformation, perpendicular component does not change: p⊥_lab = p_* sinθ*. Maximize sinθ* =1 ⇒ p⊥_max = p_* = 101 MeV/c.\n\nWait there might be additional effect from longitudinal boost causing aberration making observed angle different, but perpendicular component measured in lab defined relative to original Lambda direction (the boost axis). Under boost, transverse component stays same (no factor). Indeed p_T' = p_T . So maximum transverse momentum is just p_* = 101 MeV/c.\n\nAlternatively one could think you could get higher transverse component if combine with some longitudinal component after boosting? No, definition of component perpendicular means only transverse piece irrespective of other contributions. So it's constant independent of boost orientation; its maximum is simply the full magnitude in rest frame when emitted perpendicularly.\n\nThus answer: (i) ≈ 400 MeV/c, (ii) ≈ 100 MeV/c.\n\nProvide results with appropriate significant figures.\n\nNow craft final response with steps and formulas, include box answers.\n\nassistantfinal### (a) Threshold‑photon energy for a free proton  \n\nFor the reaction  \n\n\\[\n\\gamma(k)+p(P)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;K^{+}+ \\Lambda ^0 ,\n\\qquad \nP=(m_{p},\\,{\\bf 0}) .\n\\]\n\nThe Mandelstam variable \\(s\\) is  \n\n\\[\ns =(k+P)^{2}=m_{p}^{2}+2m_{p}E_\\gamma ,\n\\]\n\nbecause \\(k^{2}=0\\) and the proton is initially at rest.   \nAt threshold the centre‑of‑mass system contains the two outgoing particles at rest, therefore  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm thr}=m_{K}+m_{\\Lambda } .\n\\]\n\nSetting \\(s=(m_{K}+m_{\\Lambda })^{2}\\),\n\n\\[\nE_{\\gamma}^{\\rm th}\n      =\\frac{(m_{K}+m_{\\Lambda })^{2}-m_{p}^{2}}{2m_{p}}\n      =\\frac{(494+1116)^{2}-938.27^{2}}{2\\times 938.27}\\ {\\rm MeV}.\n\\]\n\nEvaluating,\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\nE_{\\gamma}^{\\rm th}\\simeq 9.1\\times 10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}\\;( \\approx 910\\;{\\rm MeV})\n}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### (b) Effect of Fermi motion  \n\nInside a nucleus the target proton possesses a typical “Fermi” momentum  \n\\(p_{F}\\sim 200\\;{\\rm MeV}/c\\) (order of magnitude).  \nAssume it moves opposite to the incoming photon (\\({\\bf p}_p=-p_{F}{\\hat z}\\)).  \n\nFour‑momenta :\n\n\\[\nk=(E_\\gamma,\\;0,0,+E_\\gamma),\\qquad    \np=\\bigl(\\sqrt{p_{F}^{2}+m_{p}^{2}},\\;0,0,-p_{F}\\bigr).\n\\]\n\nThen  \n\n\\[\ns = m_{p}^{2}+2k\\!\\cdot\\!p\n    = m_{p}^{2}+2E_\\gamma\\Bigl[\\sqrt{p_{F}^{2}+m_{p}^{2}}+p_{F}\\Bigr].\n\\]\n\nImposing the same threshold condition \\(s=(m_{K}+m_{\\Lambda })^{2}\\) gives  \n\n\\[\nE_{\\gamma}^{\\min }\n     =\\frac{(m_{K}+m_{\\Lambda })^{2}-m_{p}^{2}}\n            {2\\left(\\sqrt{p_{F}^{2}+m_{p}^{2}}+p_{F}\\right)} .\n\\]\n\nWith \\(p_{F}=200\\;{\\rm MeV}/c\\),\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{p_{F}^{2}+m_{p}^{2}}\\simeq 959\\;{\\rm MeV},\n\\qquad\nE_{\\gamma}^{\\min }\\simeq\n\\frac{1.712\\times10^{6}}{{2(959+200)}}\\;\n        \\mathrm{MeV}\\approx 7.4\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}.\n\\]\n\nUsing a somewhat larger Fermi momentum (\\(p_{F}=250\\;{\\rm MeV}/c\\))\ngives \\(E_{\\gamma}^{\\min }\\approx 7.0\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}\\).\n\nHence a realistic reduction is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{E_{\\gamma}^{\\min }\\;\\approx\\;7\\!-\\!7.5\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}},\n\\]\nsignificantly below the free‑proton threshold.\n\n---\n\n### (c) Momentum of the decay pion  \n\n#### (i) Maximum laboratory momentum  \n\nIn the \\(\\Lambda^{0}\\) rest frame the two–body decay \\(\\Lambda\\to p+\\pi^{-}\\)\nhas a fixed pion momentum  \n\n\\[\np^{*}= \\frac{\\lambda^{1/2}\\!\\bigl(m_{\\Lambda }^{2},\n                               m_{p}^{2},\n                               m_{\\pi }^{2}\\bigr)}\n               {2m_{\\Lambda }},\n\\quad\n\\lambda(a,b,c)=a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-2ab-2ac-2bc .\n\\]\n\nPutting the numerical masses,\n\n\\[\np^{*}\\simeq 1.01\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}/c ,\\qquad\nE^{*}_{\\pi}= \\sqrt{{p^{*}}^{2}+m_{\\pi }^{2}}\\simeq 1.73\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}.\n\\]\n\nThe parent \\(\\Lambda\\) travels with speed \\(\\beta=v/c=0.8\\);\nits Lorentz factor is \\(\\displaystyle\\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^{2}}}=1.667\\).\n\nBoosting the pion’s four‑momentum along the \\(\\Lambda\\)-flight direction,\nthe laboratory parallel component reads  \n\n\\[\np_{\\parallel}^{\\rm lab}= \\gamma\\,(p^{*}\\cos\\theta^{*}+\\beta E^{*}_{\\pi}),\n\\]\n\nand the transverse component is unchanged,\n\\(p_{\\perp}^{\\rm lab}=p^{*}\\sin\\theta^{*}\\).\n\nThe laboratory momentum attains its greatest value for a **forward**\nemission (\\(\\theta^{*}=0\\)):\n\n\\[\np_{\\pi}^{\\max}= \\gamma\\,(p^{*}+\\beta E^{*}_{\\pi})\n              =1.667\\,[\\,101\\;+\\;0.8\\times173\\,]\\ {\\rm MeV}/c\n              \\approx 4.0\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}/c .\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{p_{\\pi}^{\\max}\\;\\approx\\;4.0\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}/c }.\n\\]\n\n#### (ii) Maximum transverse (perpendicular) component  \n\nBecause a pure boost leaves the transverse component untouched,\nthe largest possible perpendicular momentum occurs when the pion is emitted\northogonally to the boost direction (\\(\\theta^{*}=90^\\circ\\)):\n\n\\[\np_{\\perp}^{\\max}=p^{*}\\simeq 1.0\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}/c .\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{p_{\\pi}^{\\perp,\\max}\\;\\approx\\;1.0\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}/c }.\n\\]\n\n--- \n\nThese results give the requested threshold energies and the extreme\nkinematics of the decay pion in the laboratory frame."}

Need compute energy density of blackbody radiation at temperature T=10^10 K, then convert to mass via E = mc², get mass per cubic centimeter.\n\nEnergy density u = a T⁴ where a = radiation constant = 7.5657×10^-15 erg/cm³/K⁴ = 7.5657e-15 J/m³?? Wait units: In cgs, a = 7.5657 ×10^-15 erg·cm⁻³·K⁻⁴ . Actually it's energy density per unit volume: aT⁴ with a = 7.5646×10^-15 erg·cm⁻³·K⁻⁴. Convert to SI later maybe easier.\n\nCompute:\n\nu = a * T⁴ = 7.56e-15 * (1e10)^4 erg/cm³ = 7.56e-15 * 1e40 = 7.56e25 erg/cm³.\n\nConvert erg to joules: 1 erg = 1e-7 J => u = 7.56e25 * 1e-7 = 7.56e18 J/cm³.\n\nNow mass equivalent m = u / c². c ≈ 3e8 m/s; c²≈9e16 m²/s². But careful about units: we have Joule per cm³, want kg per cm³. Use c² in J/kg: Since E = mc² → m = E/c² ; if E in J, c² in (m/s)² gives kg because 1J = 1kg·m²/s². So fine.\n\nFirst convert J per cm³ to J per m³: multiply by (100 cm per meter)^3 = 1e6. So u_m3 = 7.56e18 J/cm³ * 1e6 = 7.56e24 J/m³.\n\nThen m_density = u / c² = 7.56e24 / 9e16 = approx 0.84e8 = 8.4e7 kg/m³.\n\nNow convert kg/m³ to grams per cm³: 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 m³ = (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. So kg/m³ -> g/cm³ factor: (1000 g)/(1e6 cm³)=0.001 g/cm³ per kg/m³. Multiply: 8.4e7 kg/m³ * 0.001 = 8.4e4 g/cm³ = 84,000 g/cm³.\n\nThat's huge! That's 84 metric tons per cm³ (since 1 tonne = 1e6 g). Let's check: 84,000 g = 84 kg ~ 0.084 tonnes. Wait miscalc: 1 tonne = 1e6 g. So 84,000 g = 0.084 tonne. Hmm earlier I thought 1ton but let's recompute carefully.\n\nOur result: mass density = 8.4e7 kg/m³. Compare water density 1000 kg/m³. This is 84,000 times denser than water. That corresponds to 84,000 kg per m³? No that's wrong. Let's recalc steps.\n\nStart again using known formula: Energy density u = a T⁴. With a = 7.566e-16 J·m⁻³·K⁻⁴? Wait conversion from cgs to SI: a_SI = 7.5657e-16 J·m⁻³·K⁻⁴ (because 1 erg = 1e-7 J, and 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³, so factor 1e-7/1e-6 = 1e-1?). Let's verify: a_cgs = 7.5657e-15 erg·cm⁻³·K⁻⁴. To convert to J·m⁻³: multiply erg->J (1e-7), divide cm³->m³ (multiply by 1e6). So a_SI = 7.5657e-15 *1e-7*1e6 = 7.5657e-16 J·m⁻³·K⁻⁴. Good.\n\nThus u = 7.5657e-16 * (1e10)^4 = 7.5657e-16 * 1e40 = 7.5657e24 J/m³.\n\nThat matches our previous after converting: previously got 7.56e24 J/m³ indeed.\n\nMass density rho = u / c² = 7.5657e24 / (c²). Using exact c = 2.99792458e8, c² = 8.98755179e16. Compute ratio: 7.5657e24 / 8.98755e16 = 8.42e7 kg/m³. Yes same as before.\n\nNow convert to g per cm³: 1 kg/m³ = 0.001 g/cm³ (as above). So rho = 8.42e7 * 0.001 = 8.42e4 g/cm³ = 84200 g/cm³.\n\nIn kilograms per cm³: divide by 1000 => 84.2 kg per cm³. That's massive.\n\nSo weight per cm³: mass ~ 8.4e4 g = 84 kg. Which option among given choices: (1 ton, 1 g, 10^{-6} g, 10^{-16} g). Our value is far larger than any except perhaps 1 ton (~1e6 g). We have 8.4e4 g i.e., 0.084 ton. Not exactly listed. Maybe my calculation off due to not considering that radiation pressure vs energy density? The problem likely expects order-of-magnitude estimate. At T=10¹⁰ K, typical early universe photon gas had energy density comparable to matter? Let's approximate: Radiation energy density ∝ T⁴. At T~10⁹ K (approx MeV scale), energy density roughly 10^30 ergs/cm³? I'm not sure.\n\nLet's double-check numbers: Temperature 10^10 K corresponds to k_B T ≈ 861 keV? Actually k_B = 8.617e-5 eV/K, so T=1e10 K yields kT ≈ 862 keV. Photon average energy ~ 2.7kT ≈ 2.3 MeV. Number density n_photon = (2 ζ(3)/π²)*(kT/ħc)³ ≈ 20.28*(kT/(ħc))³. Could compute mass equivalence directly.\n\nBut trust prior calc.\n\nGiven multiple choice includes 1 ton (10^6 g) which is within one order magnitude higher than computed 8e4 g. Others are many orders lower. So best answer would be approximately 0.1 ton per cm³, closest to 1 ton? Might choose 1 ton as nearest.\n\nHowever maybe I've missed factor of 4π etc? Radiative constant a = 4σ/c where σ Stefan-Boltzmann constant = 5.670374419e-8 W·m⁻²·K⁻⁴.

We want minimal kinetic energy required to produce antiprotons.\n\nReaction likely p + p → p + p + p + anti-p? Actually creation of antiproton requires also its corresponding proton due to baryon number conservation. Starting with two protons total B=+2. Final state includes maybe three protons and one antiproton gives net B = (+1)+(+1)+(+1)+(-1)=+2 same as initial. So reaction: p + p -> p + p + p + \\bar p . That's threshold production of a proton-antiproton pair.\n\nThus we have initial lab frame where target proton at rest; projectile proton has kinetic energy T (or total energy E_lab including rest mass m_p c^2). Need threshold condition that center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) equals sum of masses of final particles: four nucleons each mass m_p (including antiproton mass equal to proton). So s_threshold = (4 m_p)^2 .\n\nNow compute needed incident kinetic energy.\n\nDefine m ≡ m_p c^2 ~938 MeV.\n\nIn lab frame: target momentum zero, so invariant s = (E_1 + m)^2 - (\\vec p_1)^2c^2 ; but using natural units c=1. For incoming proton: total energy E = T + m. Momentum magnitude p satisfies E^2 = p^2 + m^2 => p^2 = E^2 - m^2.\n\nThen s = m^2 + m^2 + 2mE = 2m^2 + 2mE . Wait formula: s = (p1+p2)^2 = m^2 + m^2 + 2(E_1 m - \\vec p_1·0 ) = 2m^2 + 2mE_1 . Yes because second particle at rest: its four-vector (m,0).\n\nSo s = 2m(m + E_1?) Let's write: s = 2m^2 + 2mE_1 = 2m( m + E_1 ). But note E_1 includes rest mass already: E_1 = T + m. Then:\n\ns = 2m^2 + 2m(T+m) = 2m^2 + 2mT + 2m^2 = 4m^2 + 2mT.\n\nWait double-check: plug E_1 = T + m :\n\ns = 2m^2 + 2m(T + m) = 2m^2 + 2mT + 2m^2 = 4m^2 + 2mT.\n\nYes.\n\nThreshold condition: s_thr = (4m)^2 =16 m^2.\n\nSet 4m^2 + 2mT = 16 m^2 ⇒ 2mT =12 m^2 ⇒ T = 6 m = 6 * 938 MeV ≈ 5628 MeV ≈ 5.63 GeV.\n\nBut options given: 6.6 GeV, 3.3 GeV, 2 GeV. Our computed about 5.6 GeV not matching exactly any option. Maybe they ask \"minimum energy\" meaning total energy (kinetic plus rest)? If total energy E_total = T + m = 6m + m =7m ≈ 6566 MeV ≈ 6.57 GeV which matches option (a) 6.6 GeV. Indeed our earlier derived T = 6m corresponds to total energy 7m = 7*938 = 6566 MeV ≈ 6.6 GeV. Option (a) says 6.6 GeV – that's probably correct if they refer to total energy of the accelerated proton (not just kinetic). Many textbooks phrase \"energy of the proton beam\". Usually they'd give kinetic energy though. However typical threshold for pp→ppp\\bar p is around 7 GeV kinetic? Let’s check known value: The threshold kinetic energy for antiproton production on fixed target is about 7 GeV (actually 7.0 GeV?). Quick recall: Antiproton production threshold in laboratory is about 7 GeV kinetic energy. Hmm I think it's about 7 GeV kinetic. Let's verify via calculation again perhaps miscount of final particles: Reaction could be p + p → p + p + p + \\bar p indeed needs 4 nucleons final. That gave T = 6m = 5.628 GeV kinetic. Some sources say threshold kinetic energy is 7 GeV? Let's recompute more carefully.\n\nGeneral formula for threshold kinetic energy for producing N new pairs etc: In lab frame, s = 2m^2 + 2mE_beam. At threshold, all final particles move together with common velocity (CM), i.e., no relative KE. Their total invariant mass M_f = Σ_i m_i . Here there will be 3 protons + 1 antiproton = 4 m. So s_thr = (Σ m_i)^2 = (4m)^2 = 16 m^2.\n\nPlugging into equation: 2m^2 + 2mE_beam = 16 m^2 ⇒ divide 2m: m + E_beam = 8 m ⇒ E_beam = 7 m. Note careful: dividing both sides by 2m yields: m + E_beam = 8 m ⇒ E_beam = 7 m. This E_beam is total energy of beam proton (including rest). Therefore kinetic energy K = E_beam - m = 6 m = 5.628 GeV. Good.\n\nHence total energy required is 7 m ≈ 6.58 GeV, close to 6.6 GeV choice (a). So answer should be (a): 6.6 GeV.\n\nLet's craft explanation steps.\n\nassistantfinalThe reaction that creates an antiproton when a fast proton hits a stationary hydrogen atom (another proton) must conserve **baryon number**.  \n\nStarting with two protons \\((B=+2)\\) the lowest‑mass final state containing an antiproton is  \n\n\\[\np + p \\;\\longrightarrow\\; p + p + p + \\overline p ,\n\\]\n\nwhich contains three protons and one antiproton \\(\\;(B=+2)\\).\nAll four outgoing particles can be produced at rest in their centre–of–mass (COM) frame at the threshold.\n\n---\n\n### 1.

For each indicate by S,E,W those classes of interactions—strong, electromagnetic, weak—for which no violation of the symmetry or conservation law has been observed.\" So we have three interaction types; we mark with letters where it's conserved (no violation). Then also pick one law that does show violation experimentally, give experiment.\n\nSo:\n\na) I-spin (isospin) conservation: Strong interactions conserve isospin approximately; EM breaks due to charge differences but still approximate? Isospin symmetry broken by electromagnetism because up/down quark masses differ and charges cause splitting. In EM processes, isospin not strictly conserved. Weak interactions definitely violate isospin strongly (change flavor). So only strong shows no violation observed. So answer: S yes, E no, W no => S.\n\nb) I3 (third component of isospin): This corresponds to electric charge via Gell-Mann–Nishijima Q = I3 + Y/2 . Conservation of I3 would imply charge conservation? Actually I3 is related to difference between proton/neutron numbers etc. Electromagnetic interactions do conserve electric charge, thus they should conserve I3 if hypercharge unchanged? But EM can change I3? Example: photon coupling respects isospin? The EM current is combination of I=0 and I=1 components leading to some selection rules. However EM interactions generally break isospin symmetry because different couplings to u,d due to their charges. Yet total I3 may be conserved? Let's think: Reaction like π+ → μ+ νμ involves weak, changes I3 from pion (+1) to muon (+1?) Muon lepton number separate. Not relevant.\n\nBetter recall classification: Strong interactions conserve both I and its third component exactly (to good approximation). Electromagnetic interactions conserve I3? Since EM couples proportionally to charge, which depends on I3 plus hypercharge, so overall I3 might not be conserved individually. Eg., process γ p -> Δ++? That's allowed though I3 changes? Proton I3=+½, Delta ++ I3=+3/2, photon I3=0, net initial I3=+½, final =+3/2 violates I3 unless other particle emitted. So single-photon absorption cannot increase I3 alone; indeed photoproduction of Δ++ requires additional pi- emission maybe. So EM conserves I3 as part of angular momentum? I'm uncertain.\n\nWeak interactions certainly violate I3 heavily (charged currents change it).\n\nThus likely answer: No violations observed for strong only again. Maybe EM also conserves I3? I'd say EM does not necessarily conserve I3 because charge is conserved but I3 could shift while hypercharge compensates. Hypercharge includes baryon number etc. For hadrons, Y = B+S... Changing I3 without changing Y leads to charge change, violating charge conservation. Thus EM can't change I3 independently. Therefore EM conserves I3 as well (since charge is conserved). Indeed I3 = (Q - Y/2), Y fixed for given reaction (e.g., same set of particles). If EM doesn't create strange quarks, Y constant, then I3 conserved. So perhaps EM also obeys I3 conservation. Many textbooks state that isospin symmetry is exact for strong, broken by EM and mass differences, but I3 is linked to charge, which is always conserved. So I3 is conserved in all interactions because it's essentially half the difference between up-type and down-type quantum numbers? Wait weak charged currents change I3 by ±1 (like d→u e−ν̄ ), that's weak violation. So I3 is violated only by weak charged currents. Hence answer: S and E conserve I3, W does not.\n\nc) Strangeness conservation: Strong interactions conserve strangeness; EM also conserves strangeness (photons don't carry strangeness); weak interactions can change strangeness (ΔS=±1) e.g., K decay. So S and E no violation observed; W violation observed. So mark S,E.\n\nd) CP invariance: Historically thought universal, but known violation in weak interactions (K meson decays, later B mesons). Strong and EM appear to respect CP within experimental limits (though possible small theta term?). So S and E conserved, W violated.\n\nNow need to choose one law where violation was observed and describe experiment establishing it. Could select CP violation discovered in neutral kaon system (Cronin-Fitch experiment 1964). Or strangeness non-conservation in weak decays (kaon decay).

", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to find threshold energy (minimum kinetic or total?) for K^- production when pion hits stationary proton producing some reaction that yields K-. Likely reaction: π⁻ + p → Λ⁰ + K⁰ ? Wait K- requires negative kaon; possible reactions:\n\nπ⁺ + n -> K+ + Λ0 etc.\n\nBut with π− hitting proton we can produce K- plus something else conserving charge, baryon number, strangeness.\n\nInitial: π⁻ (charge -1, S=0) + p (+1). Total charge =0. Need final state includes K⁻ (charge -1, S=-1) plus hyperon(s) carrying opposite strangeness +1 to conserve overall strangeness zero initially. So likely reaction: π⁻ + p → K⁻ + Σ⁺? Let's check charges: K- (-1), Σ+ (+1) gives net 0 good. Strangeness: K- has S=-1, Σ+ has S=-1? Actually Σ hyperons have S=-1 as well. That would give total S=-2 not allowed. We need one particle with S=+1 like Λ⁰ (S=-1)? Wait strange quantum numbers: Strange quark s carries S = -1. Anti-strange anti-s has S = +1. Kaon K- contains s̄ u? Actually K- = s̄ u . Contains anti-strange => S = +1. Yes! Good recall: K+ = u s̄ (strangeness +1?), hmm let's verify: The convention: Strange quark s has S = -1, anti-strange s-bar has S = +1. Therefore K+ (u s̄) has S = +1, K- (s ū ) has S = -1? Wait K- composition: s ū ; that's strange quark s (S=-1) and anti-up. So K- has S = -1. Indeed K- contains s (not anti-s). Similarly K0 (d s̄)?? Actually K0 = d s̄ (has anti-s) so S=+1. And anti-K0 = s d̄ (S=-1). So K- has S=-1. Then to conserve strangeness initial S=0, need another particle with S=+1 i.e., hyperon containing anti-strange? But there aren't stable particles with anti-strange except maybe antiproton? Not typical. Instead you could produce pair of strange hadrons such that total S=0 e.g., K- (S=-1) + Λ⁰ (S=-1) no sum -2. That's wrong. Actually hyperons contain strange quarks giving S=-1 each. To get total S=0 you need also an anti-hyperon (with anti-strange) but those are heavy. More common associated production uses K+ (S=+1) together with Λ (S=-1). For K- you'd need associate production with a positive strange antibaryon like Σ¯? Reaction: π⁻ + p → K⁻ + Σ⁺??? Σ⁺ has S=-1 again. So total S=-2. Not allowed.\n\nThus perhaps they ask about K- production via π⁻ + p → K⁰ + Λ⁰? No K-.\n\nLet's think: Could produce K- along with a neutron and a double-charged hyperon? Eg π⁻ + p → K⁻ + Δ++ ??? Δ++ has no strangeness. Still S mismatch.\n\nTherefore maybe they consider production of K- accompanied by a nucleon and a hyperon-antihyperon pair? Might be high threshold.\n\nAlternatively maybe they mean \"threshold for K-\" meaning minimal incident pion momentum needed to create any process where a K- appears among products, possibly including additional mesons/baryons. Simplest might be π⁻ + p → K⁰ + Λ⁰ + π⁻? Hmm still no K-.\n\nBetter search memory: Known reaction: π⁻ + p → K⁰ + Λ⁰ (produces K0 not K-). Another: π⁻ + p → K⁰ + Σ⁰. Production of K- typically from π⁻ + p → K⁰ + K⁻ + p? This creates K- plus other stuff ensuring strangeness zero: two kaons (one K-, one K+) would cancel strangeness. Example: π⁻ + p → K⁰ + K⁻ + p? Check charges: left side total Q=0. Right side: K⁰(0)+K⁻(-1)+p(+1)=0 ok. Strangeness: K⁰(S=+1)?, wait earlier we said K0 = d s̄ (anti-s) thus S=+1. K- S=-1. Sum 0. Baryon number conserved (initial 1, final p 1). So this works. So threshold corresponds to creation of a K⁻K⁰ pair.\n\nThus minimum mass final system: p + K⁰ + K⁻. Compute threshold lab kinetic energy of incoming π⁻ onto stationary proton.\n\nUse invariant mass squared s = m_π² + m_p² + 2 m_p E_lab (where E_lab is total energy of pion). At threshold all final particles move together in CM rest frame (i.e., produced at rest relative to each other): total CM energy sqrt{s}_thr = M_final_total = m_p + m_K⁰ + m_{K⁻}. Since masses equal for neutral/charged kaons ~493.677 MeV/c² (both similar). Use values: m_pi ≈139.570 MeV (π⁻); m_p≈938.272 MeV; m_K≈493.677 MeV.\n\nSo compute required s_thr = (m_p + 2 m_K)^2 because both kaons same mass approx. = (938.272 + 2*493.677)^2 = (938.272 + 987.354) =1925.626 MeV. Square: (1.9256 GeV)^2 =3.708... GeV^2. Let's calculate precisely: 1.925626 GeV. Square: 1.925626^2 = 3.709... We'll approximate 3.71 (GeV)^2.\n\nNow s = m_π² + m_p² + 2 m_p E_beam (total energy). Solve for E_beam (total) then subtract m_π to get KE.\n\nCompute m_π² = (0.13957)^2 =0.01948 GeV^2. m_p²=(0.93827)^2=0.88035 GeV^2. Sum =0.89983 GeV^2.\n\nSet s_thr =0.89983 + 2*m_p *E_beam.\n\n=> 2*m_p*E_beam = s_thr -0.89983.\n\nFirst compute s_thr: (1.925626)^2 =? Let's do more precise multiplication: 1.925626*1.925626.\n\n1.9*1.9=3.61. Additional terms: using calculator mental: (1.9256)^2 = (1.92+0.0056)^2 = 1.92^2 +2*1.92*0.0056 +0.0056^2 =3.6864 +0.021504 +3.136e-5 ≈3.70794. Slight difference due to rounding. Using our value 1.925626: square maybe 3.70899. Accept around 3.709 GeV^2.\n\nSubtract 0.8998 => 2.8092 GeV^2.\n\nThen divide by (2*m_p) where m_p=0.93827 GeV. 2*m_p =1.87654 GeV.\n\nE_beam = 2.8092 /1.8765 = 1.498 GeV.\n\nThat's total energy of pion. Subtract its rest mass 0.13957 => kinetic energy T_beam ≈1.358 GeV.\n\nCorresponding momentum p = √(E^2 - m^2) = √(1.498^2 -0.1396^2) GeV = √(2.244 -0.0195)=√2.2245=1.492 GeV/c roughly.\n\nThus threshold kinetic energy about 1.36 GeV (~1.5 GeV total).\n\nProvide answer.\n\nWill present steps and final boxed result.\n\nassistantfinalThe simplest way to obtain a \\(K^{-}\\) in a collision of a \\(\\pi ^{-}\\) with a stationary proton while keeping overall strangeness zero is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\\pi ^{-}+p\\longrightarrow p+K^{0}+K^{-}\\;}\n\\]\n\n(the two kaons carry opposite strangeness, \\(S(K^{0})=+1,\\;S(K^{-})=-1\\)).  \nAt threshold all three final‑state particles move together in their centre–of‑mass (CM) frame, therefore the invariant mass squared of the system satisfies  \n\n\\[\ns_{\\text{thr}}=\\bigl(m_{p}+m_{K^{0}}+m_{K^{-}}\\bigr)^{2}\n            =(m_{p}+2\\,m_{K})^{2},\n\\]\nbecause \\(m_{K^{0}}\\approx m_{K^{-}}\\equiv m_{K}=493.677~\\text{MeV}/c^{2}\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1 – Write the Mandelstam variable \\(s\\)\n\nFor a projectile of total laboratory energy \\(E_\\pi\\) striking a target at rest,\n\n\\[\ns=m_{\\pi}^{2}+m_{p}^{2}+2\\,m_{p}E_{\\pi}.\n\\]\n\nHere \\(m_{\\pi}=139.570~\\text{MeV},\\; m_{p}=938.272~\\text{MeV}\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2 – Impose the threshold condition  \n\n\\[\nm_{\\pi}^{2}+m_{p}^{2}+2\\,m_{p}E_{\\pi}^{\\rm thr}\n      =(m_{p}+2m_{K})^{2}.\n\\]\n\nInsert the numerical masses (\\(m_{K}=493.677~\\text{MeV}\\)) :\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&(0.13957)^{2}+(0.93827)^{2}+2(0.93827)\\,E_{\\pi}^{\\rm thr}\\\\\n&\\qquad =\\left(0.93827+2\\times0.49368\\right)^{2}\\\\[2mm]\n&\\Rightarrow\\;\n2(0.93827)\\,E_{\\pi}^{\\rm thr}= (1.92563)^{2}-[(0.13957)^{2}+(0.93827)^{2}]\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\;\n2(0.93827)\\,E_{\\pi}^{\\rm thr}=3.709\\ {\\rm GeV}^{2}-0.900\\ {\\rm GeV}^{2}=2.809\\ {\\rm GeV}^{2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nHence  \n\n\\[\nE_{\\pi}^{\\rm thr}= \\frac{2.809}{2\\times0.93827}=1.50\\ {\\rm GeV}.\n\\]\n\nThis is the **total** energy of the incoming pion.

Justify your answers by reference to experimental evidence.\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to explain \"strength\" meaning coupling constants, cross sections, etc., quantitative comparison e.g., α_s ~1 (at low energies), α_em = 1/137, G_F~10^-5 GeV^{-2}, Newton's constant G_N ~6.7e-39 GeV^{-2}. Also talk about dimensionless measures like fine structure constant analogs; running couplings with energy scale. Then part b: list conserved quantities per interaction:\n\nStrong: color charge, baryon number? Actually strong conserves flavor quantum numbers except those broken via weak interactions: strangeness not strictly conserved but approx due to SU(3). Strong respects all additive quantum numbers: electric charge, lepton number, baryon number, isospin (approx), parity, C, CP, time reversal (strong CP problem small). So we can say that strong interaction conserves colour, flavour (except heavy quark decays mediated by weak), baryon number, total angular momentum, parity, C, CP, T individually (to high precision).\n\nElectromagnetic: Conserves electric charge, photon couples to EM current => gauge invariance leads to charge conservation. Parity, C, CP are conserved (EM respects P and C separately). Lepton/baryon numbers also conserved because they don't involve EM vertices. Angular momentum, CPT always.\n\nWeak: Violates several symmetries: does NOT conserve parity (maximal violation), violates C, CP (small CP violation observed in K0 system), also changes flavor – it doesn't conserve individual flavors (strangeness, charm, bottomness, topness); only conserves electric charge overall, B-L maybe? Weak interactions conserve total lepton number (separately electron/muon/tau families approximately, though neutrino oscillations show family lepton numbers violated but total L still conserved in SM). Total baryon number conserved perturbatively. It also conserves color (since W bosons are singlets under QCD). The weak charged currents change isospin doublet components, so weak hypercharge Y is conserved. In neutral currents Z exchange preserves flavor (no FCNC at tree level). We should mention selection rules from experiments: beta decay shows V-A nature, parity violation measured in Wu experiment, CP violation seen in kaon mixing, etc.\n\nNeed justification referencing experimental evidence: scattering cross-section measurements showing orders-of-magnitude differences; measurement of coupling constants; observation of parity non-conservation; CP violation; conservation of charge through precise tests; absence of certain processes indicating forbidden transitions (like no proton decay → baryon number conservation in strong/electroweak). Provide citations perhaps.\n\nFinally present final answer box.\n\nLet's craft response.assistantfinal**Answer**\n\n---\n\n### (a) What “strength’’ means and how the four forces are ordered  \n\nIn particle‑physics the *strength* of an interaction is quantified by the **dimensionless effective coupling** that appears in the lowest–order matrix element for a typical process involving that force.   \n\n| Interaction | Coupling (low‐energy) | Dimensionless measure |\n|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Strong**   | \\(g_{s}\\) (QCD)      | \\(\\displaystyle\\alpha _{s}= \\frac {g_{s}^{\\,2}}{4\\pi }\\) |\n| **Electromag­netic** | \\(e\\)                | \\(\\displaystyle\\alpha_{\\rm em}= \\frac {e^{2}}{4\\pi }= \\frac13 37\\) |\n| **Weak**     | Fermi constant \\(G_{F}\\) (from $W$–exchange) | \\(\\displaystyle\\alpha _{\\!w}= \\frac{G_{F}M_{Z}^{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\;\\;( {\\rm dim.\\,less})\\) |\n| **Gravitational** | Newton’s constant \\(G_{N}\\) (or Planck mass) | \\(\\displaystyle\\alpha _{G}= \\frac{E^{2}}{M_{\\!P}^{2}}\\) (runs with the energy \\(E\\)) |\n\n*Why these definitions work*\n\n* The **matrix element** for a two‑particle scattering or decay contains a factor proportional to the square of the relevant coupling.   \n* Squaring the amplitude gives a probability ∝ coupling² ⇒ the larger the coupling, the higher the reaction rate (cross section or width).    \n* By dividing out the trivial phase‑space factors one obtains a pure number – the *effective fine‑structure constant* of the interaction. This makes different forces comparable even though their underlying theories have very different dimensions.\n\n#### Numerical values (taken at a characteristic laboratory scale ≈ 1 GeV)\n\n* Strong : \\(\\alpha _{s}(1\\text{ GeV})\\!\\sim\\!0.8\\) (of order unity)\n* Electromag.: \\(\\alpha_{\\rm em}=1/137\\simeq7.30\\times10^{-3}\\)\n* Weak : \\(\\displaystyle\\alpha _{w}\n          =\\frac{G_{F}M_{Z}^{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n          \\approx\\frac{1.166\\times10^{-5}{\\rm GeV}^{-2}\\,(91.2)^2}{\\sqrt{2}}\n          \\simeq 1.0\\times10^{-5}\\)\n* Gravity (for a particle of kinetic energy \\(E\\)=1 GeV): \\(\\displaystyle \n          \\alpha_G=\\frac{E^2}{M_P^2}\n                  =\\frac{(1\\;{\\rm GeV})^{2}}{(1.22\\times10^{19}\\;{\\rm GeV})^{2}}\n                  \\simeq 6.7\\times10^{-39}\\)\n\nHence the hierarchy  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\alpha_{s}\\;:\\;\\alpha_{\\rm em}\\;:\\;\\alpha_{w}\\;:\\;\\alpha_{G}\n\\;\\approx\\;\n1\\;:\\;10^{-2}\\;:\\;10^{-5}\\;:\\;10^{-38}\n}\n\\]\n\nwhich is exactly the ordering quoted in textbooks: **strong > electromagnetic > weak > gravitation**.\n\nOther ways of expressing the same information are:\n\n* **Cross‑section ratios:** e.g. hadron–hadron scattering at few‑GeV energies has σ∼10⁻³ barn whereas elastic electron–electron scattering at the same kinematics yields σ∼10⁻⁶ barn, i.e. a factor ≃10³ smaller, reflecting the ratio \\(\\alpha_{s}/\\alpha_{\\rm em}\\).\n* **Decay widths:** A typical strong resonance (\\(\\rho\\rightarrow\\pi\\pi\\)) has Γ≈150 MeV while a purely electroweak decay such as muon decay (\\(\\mu\\to e\\nu\\bar\\nu\\)) has Γ≈\\(3\\times10^{-19}\\) GeV, again differing by roughly five orders of magnitude consistent with \\((\\alpha_{s}/\\alpha_w )^{2}\\).\n\nBecause the couplings run with the transferred momentum \\(Q\\) (as dictated by renormalisation group equations), the numerical hierarchy varies slightly with energy, but the above pattern holds over many decades of experimentally accessible scales.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### (b) Conserved quantum numbers for the three non‑gravitational forces  \n\nBelow we list the additive quantum numbers that are **exactly** respected by each interaction (within the Standard Model) together with the key experimental observations that confirm them.\n\n| Force | Conserved quantity(s) | Experimental support |\n|-------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Strong (Quantum Chromodynamics)** | • **Colour charge** (SU(3)\\(_c\\) gauge symmetry)<br>• **Baryon number** \\(B\\) <br>• **Electric charge** \\(Q\\) (because photons do not couple directly to gluons)<br>• **Total angular momentum** \\(J\\) , **Parity** \\(P\\) , **Charge conjugation** \\(C\\) (each preserved in strong reactions up to tiny violations known as the “strong‑CP” puzzle) | - Deep‑inelastic scattering shows that coloured objects never appear isolated (**colour confinement**) → colour is a good quantum number.<br>- High‑precision measurements of hadronic production rates obey exact **isospin multiplet** relations, implying that strong amplitudes respect \\(I_3\\) and thus electric charge.<br>- No observed processes violating baryon number within strong interactions (e.g. no rapid p→π⁰+e⁺ decay).<br>- Observables such as η′ mass place stringent limits on any strong‑CP term (θ̄≲10⁻¹⁰). |\n| **Electromagnetic (U(1)\\(_{em}\\))** | • **Electric charge** \\(Q\\) (local U(1) gauge invariance) <br>• **Lepton number** \\(L_e,L_\\mu,L_\\tau\\) & **Baryon number** \\(B\\) (they commute with the EM Hamiltonian) <br>• **Parity**, **Charge conjugation**, **Time reversal** (the Maxwell/Lagrangian is invariant under each separately) <br>• **Angular momentum** | - **Charge conservation** verified to better than 10⁻²⁰ in Millikan‑type oil‑drop experiments and modern Penning‑trap comparisons of electron vs positron cyclotron frequencies.<br>- Photon emission/absorption never changes net lepton or baryon count (e.g. atomic spectroscopy, Compton scattering).<br>- Precise tests of discrete symmetries: optical activity of crystals, Mössbauer experiments, and searches for EDMs give null results, confirming that ordinary EM processes preserve \\(P,\\;C,\\;T\\) individually. |\n| **Weak (SU(2)\\(_L\\)×U(1)\\(_Y\\))** | • **Electric charge** (overall charge is unchanged in both charged‑current and neutral‑current processes) <br>• **Color** (weak bosons are colour‑singlets) <br>• **Total lepton number** \\(L=L_e+L_\\mu+L_\\tau\\) (conserved in all observed weak decays) <br>• **Baryon number** \\(B\\) (perturbative weak interactions do not violate \\(B\\)) <br>• **Energy–momentum** and **angular momentum** (Lorentz invariance) | - **Violation of parity** discovered in β‑decay (Wu et al., 1957) showed that left‑handed fermions participate uniquely → demonstrates that \\(P\\) is *not* conserved, distinguishing the weak force.<br>- **Charge‑conjugation violation** follows from maximal handedness; direct C‑violation shown in Kaon semileptonic asymmetries.<br>- **CP violation** observed in neutral‑kaon mixing (Cronin– Fitch, 1964) and later in B‑meson systems confirms that neither \\(C\\) nor \\(P\\) hold separately, although the combined CPT remains exact (KLOE, BaBar, Belle data).<br>- **Flavor changing**: Charged‑current weak interactions convert one member of an SU(2) doublet into its partner (e.g. d↔u, s↔c).

Reaction leads to two neutrons.\n\nInitial system: π− bound atomic orbital p-state around deuteron? Actually \"captured ... from a p orbit\". Means pion captured into nuclear orbit with angular momentum l=1 relative to deuteron; so total initial J^π includes contributions from deuteron spin S_d=1, plus orbital L between π and d which is 1 (since p-orbit), plus internal spin of pion zero. So overall initial total angular momentum J_i can couple as vector sum of S_d (=1) and L (=1): possible J_i = 0,1,2. Parities multiply: P(π)= - , P(d)= (+) ; also factor (-1)^L due to spatial wavefunction? For composite system parity = product of intrinsic parities times (-1)^L . Intrinsic parity of π- is -, deuteron + => net intrinsic = -. Then multiplied by (-1)^L where L=1 gives extra minus sign -> overall parity = (-)(-) = + . Wait compute: P_total_initial = η_π * η_d * (-1)^L = (-)*(+) *(-1)^1 = (+). Good.\n\nFinal state: Two neutrons. Each neutron has spin ½, intrinsic parity + (baryons have +). No orbital angular momentum maybe? Need to consider allowed combinations consistent with conservation of total J and parity. Since strong interaction conserves parity and angular momentum. Also exchange symmetry requires antisymmetry under interchange of identical fermions (neutrons).\n\nLet’s denote their combined spin S_nn (singlet S=0 or triplet S=1). Their relative orbital angular momentum ℓ (call it L_f). Total J_f results from coupling S and ℓ. Parity of nn pair = intrinsic product (+*+) = + times (-1)^ℓ = (-1)^ℓ .\n\nConservation:\n\nParity: Initial parity + equals final parity (-1)^ℓ → thus ℓ even (ℓ = 0,2,...). Smallest likely ℓ=0 s-wave.\n\nNow we examine total angular momentum possibilities given ℓ even. With ℓ=0, J_f=S_nn because only spin contributes. Thus J_f could be 0 (if singlet) or 1 (triplet). But we must match one of the possible J_i values (0,1,2). Both 0 and 1 are allowed. However there may be additional constraints from selection rules like transition operator being scalar/pseudoscalar etc. Capture via strong interaction perhaps dominated by s-wave absorption (low energy). Additionally requirement of antisymmetric total wavefunction for two neutrons: Overall wavefunction = space × spin × isospin (but both neutrons same iso, I_z=-1/2 each). Neutron-neutron system has isospin I=1 (symmetric) since two identical nucleons combine symmetrically in isospin when they are both neutrons (I3 = -1). Indeed NN states: pp and nn correspond to I=1 symmetric, while np can be either I=0 antisymmetric or I=1 symmetric. Therefore for nn, isospin part is symmetric. To satisfy Pauli principle, total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. Spatial×spin must then be antisymmetric. For ℓ even (symmetrical spatial), spin must be antisymmetric ⇒ singlet S=0.

Using c=1 units. So s = 2 m_e² + 2 m_e E_beam. Since m_e << M_Z, ignore first term maybe not necessary. Solve for E_beam: s = M_Z² => 2 m_e E_beam ≈ M_Z² -> E_beam = M_Z²/(2 m_e). Plug numbers: M_Z = 91.1876 GeV actual but given 92 GeV. Use 92 GeV. Convert MeV: m_e = 0.511 MeV = 5.11×10^{-4} GeV. So denominator 2*5.11e-4 = 1.022e-3 GeV. Numerator (92)^2 = 8464 GeV². Divide: 8464 / 0.001022 ≈ 8.28 ×10^{6} GeV = 8.3 PeV! Let's calculate precisely: 8464 / 0.001022 = 8280000 approx. Yes about 8.3 million GeV = 8.3 TeV? Wait 1 TeV = 1000 GeV, so it's 8300 TeV? Actually 8.3 million GeV = 8300 TeV = 8.3 PeV. Indeed huge.\n\nSo required positron beam energy ~8.3×10⁶ GeV (~8 PeV). This shows why colliders are better than fixed-target for high-energy particle creation.\n\nBut perhaps they want expression including electron mass: E_beam = (M_Z² - 2 m_e²)/(2 m_e) ≈ M_Z²/(2 m_e). We'll give numeric value.\n\nNow (c): After production in fixed target scenario, what is energy and velocity of produced Z in lab frame? The Z's momentum comes from initial system net momentum: incoming positron had momentum p_beam along z, target electron zero. Total momentum before collision = p_beam (vector). After production, Z carries all momentum (assuming no other particles). Its energy E_Z = γ M_Z ; its momentum p_Z = γ β M_Z. We know total four-momentum conserved: (E_beam + m_e , p_beam ) = (E_Z , p_Z ). Therefore E_Z = E_beam + m_e, p_Z = p_beam.\n\nGiven E_beam >> m_e, approximate p_beam≈E_beam (neglect mass). So gamma factor: γ = E_Z/M_Z = (E_beam + m_e)/M_Z ≈ E_beam/M_Z.\n\nCompute numerically: E_beam ≈ 8.284×10⁶ GeV, add m_e negligible. So γ ≈ 8.284×10⁶ / 92 ≈ 9.01×10⁴ ? let's compute: 8.284e6 / 92 = 90,043.5. Wait that's 9.0×10⁴. Good.\n\nVelocity beta = p/E = p_Z/E_Z = p_beam /(E_beam + m_e) ≈ E_beam/(E_beam) = ~1 minus tiny difference due to mass. More accurately, use relation β = √(1-1/γ²). With γ~9.0×10⁴, β≈1 - ½γ^{-2}=1 - 6.17×10^{-10}. So essentially speed very close to c.\n\nAlternatively compute exact formula: β = p/Z_E = √(E_beam² - m_e²)/ (E_beam + m_e). Approx ~1 - m_e/E_beam etc.\n\nWe'll present values: E_Z ≈ 8.284×10⁶ GeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 8.284×10⁶ GeV (same). Velocity v ≈ c (β≈0.9999999997).\n\nNow (d): Decay Z→μ⁺ μ⁻ isotropic in Z rest frame presumably. Want max energy of one muon observed in lab frame. When boost along Z motion, the most energetic muon occurs when it emitted forward (along Z velocity). In Z rest frame, muon energy = M_Z/2 (ignoring muon mass?). Muon mass m_mu = 105.66 MeV ≪ M_Z, but keep maybe. Rest-frame muon energy: E*_µ = (M_Z² + m_µ²)/(2 M_Z) ≈ (M_Z/2)(1 + (m_µ²/M_Z²)). Approximately M_Z/2 = 46 GeV plus tiny correction. Momentum in rest frame: p_* = λ^(1/2)(M_Z²,m_µ²,m_µ²)/(2 M_Z) = sqrt[(M_Z²/4)-m_µ²] ≈ M_Z/2 * sqrt[1 - 4 m_µ²/M_Z²] ≈ 45.999… GeV.\n\nBoost to lab: Lab energy E_lab = γ (E_* + β p_* cos θ*) where θ*= angle between muon's direction and boost axis. Max when cosθ*=1 (forward). So E_max = γ (E_* + β p_* ).\n\nSince β≈1, we can write approximately E_max ≈ γ (E_* + p_* ) ≈ γ (M_Z/2 + M_Z/2) = γ M_Z. Because for ultra-relativistic limit, E_*≈p_*≈M_Z/2. Hence E_max ≈ γ M_Z = (E_Z/M_Z)*M_Z = E_Z. That makes sense: the forward muon can take almost entire Z energy. Slightly less due to muon mass.\n\nLet's compute more precise: Use γ computed earlier ~9.004×10⁴, β≈√(1-1/γ²) ≈ 0.999999999994. Take E_* = (M_Z² + m_µ²)/(2 M_Z). Insert numbers: M_Z=92 GeV, m_µ=0.106 GeV. Compute numerator: 92² = 8464, m_µ² = 0.011236, sum = 8474.236. Divided by 184 gives ≈ 46.0585 GeV. Similarly p_* = sqrt[E_*² - m_µ²] = sqrt[46.0585² - 0.011236] ≈ sqrt[2121.38 - 0.011]=sqrt[2121.37]≈46.057 GeV (essentially same). So E_*+β p_* ≈ 46.0585 + 0.99999999999*46.057 ≈ 92.1155 GeV (slightly > M_Z!). Multiply by γ: E_max ≈ γ * 92.1155 GeV ≈ 9.004e4 * 92.1155 ≈ 8.295e6 GeV. Compare to E_Z = 8.284e6 GeV. Slightly higher due to muon kinetic energy addition? Actually can't exceed total Z energy. Something off: Should satisfy conservation: Sum of two muon energies cannot exceed E_Z. Maximum single muon energy < E_Z. Our approximation gave slightly above because we used β≈1 but actually β<1 leads to reduction enough to bring below E_Z. Let's compute correctly: Use exact formulas.\n\nLet’s denote γ = E_Z/M_Z, β = p_Z/E_Z = sqrt(1-1/γ²). Then E_max = γ (E_* + β p_*). Write as:\n\nE_max = γ [E_* + β p_*].\n\nPlug numbers: γ = E_Z/M_Z = (E_beam + m_e)/M_Z ≈ 8.284e6 / 92 = 90043.48.\n\nCalculate β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - 1/(8.108e9)) ≈ 1 - 0.5*(1/γ²) = 1 - 0.5*1.233e-10 = 1 - 6.165e-11 ≈ 0.99999999993835.\n\nNow compute E_* = (M_Z² + m_µ²)/(2 M_Z) = (8464 + 0.011236)/184 = 8464.011236/184 = 46.02178? Wait recalc: 8464 + 0.011236 = 8464.011236. divide by 184 yields 46.01855? Let's do accurate: 184*46 = 8464. So extra 0.011236/184 = 6.103e-5. So E_* = 46 + 6.103e-5 = 46.00006103 GeV. Hmm my previous calc was wrong because I added incorrectly. Let's recompute properly: M_Z=92 GeV, squared = 8464 GeV². Add m_µ² = (0.105658 GeV)² = 0.011164 GeV² roughly. Sum = 8464.01116. Divide by 2*M_Z = 184 GeV gives 46.0000605 GeV. So indeed just barely over half.\n\nSimilarly p_* = sqrt(E_*² - m_µ²) = sqrt((46.0000605)² - 0.011164) . Compute (46.0000605)² = 2116.00557? Actually 46²=2116. Additional cross terms: 2*46*0.0000605 ≈ 0.005566, plus square of small term negligible. So ~2116.00614. Subtract 0.011164 => 2105.995? wait miscalc. Let's compute again: 46² = 2116. So adding small increments: (46 + δ)² = 2116 + 92δ + δ². δ=6.05e-5, 92δ≈0.005566, δ² negligible. So result ≈2116.005566. subtract m_µ²=0.011164 => 2105.?? No hold on subtraction should be 2116.005566 - 0.011164 = 2115.994402. Square root gives ≈46.000? sqrt near 46. So p_* ≈ 45.99996? Let's compute: sqrt(2115.9944) vs 46²=2116. Difference -0.0056. derivative d sqrt/dx = 1/(2 sqrt) ≈ 1/92. So change ≈ (-0.0056)/92 = -6.09e-5. So p_* ≈ 46 - 6.09e-5 = 45.999939 GeV. So p_* ≈ 45.99994 GeV.\n\nNow compute inside bracket: E_* + β p_* = 46.0000605 + 0.99999999993835 * 45.999939 ≈ 46.0000605 + 45.999934 ≈ 92. -? sum = 92. -? 46.0000605+45.999934 = 92. -? It's 92. -? 46.0000605+45.999934 = 92. -? Actually 46.0000605+45.999934 = 92. -? 46+45.999934=91.999934, plus 0.0000605 = 91.9999945. So around 91.9999945 GeV, basically M_Z minus few micro-eV. Good.\n\nMultiply by γ: E_max = γ * 91.9999945 GeV = 90043.48 * 91.9999945 ≈ 8.283999e6 GeV (close to E_Z). Indeed maximal muon gets nearly whole Z energy, leaving little for other muon.\n\nHence answer: E_max ≈ E_Z (i.e., about 8.3×10⁶ GeV). Could also express fraction: (1+β)/2 times something? General formula: E_max = γ (E_* + β p_* ), min = γ (E_* - β p_* ).\n\nProvide numerical results.\n\nSummaries:\n\n(a) Beam energy per particle = 46 GeV.\n\n(b) Positron beam energy ≈ M_Z²/(2 m_e) ≈ 8.3×10⁶ GeV ≈ 8.3 PeV.\n\n(c) Produced Z energy E_Z = E_beam + m_e ≈ 8.3×10⁶ GeV; Lorentz factor γ ≈ 9.0×10⁴; velocity β≈1 – 6×10⁻¹¹ (v≈c).\n\n(d) Max muon energy in lab ≈ γ (E_* + β p_*) ≈ 8.28×10⁶ GeV (practically the full Z energy); minimal would be similar low.\n\nWill put answers in LaTeX box.\n\nAlso note that for colliding beams case, Z is at rest in lab, thus its energy = M_Z, velocity zero. Might ask part (c) only for fixed target case.

GeV.\n\nIn CM frame (rest frame of Xi), we have two-body decay isotropic; given Lambda emerges at angle θ* =30° relative to original Xi direction (which defines z axis? Actually they say \"initial Xi direction\" which in CM same as lab direction because boost is collinear. In CM, before decay Xi was at rest so there is no defined direction but we can define axes such that the boost direction corresponds to +x. They give lambda's emission angle measured w.r.t this direction. Good.)\n\nFirst compute magnitude of daughter momenta in CM using standard formula:\n\np* = λ^{1/2}(M_Xi^2, M_Lambda^2, M_pi^2)/(2 M_Xi)\n\nwhere λ(a,b,c)=a^2+b^2+c^2 -2ab-2ac-2bc.\n\nCompute masses squared:\nM_Xi=1.3 => M_Xi^2=1.69\nM_Λ=1.1 => ^2=1.21\nMπ=0.14=> ^2=0.0196\n\nNow λ = M_Xi^4 + M_Λ^4 + M_π^4 -2 M_Xi^2 M_Λ^2 -2 M_Xi^2 M_π^2 -2 M_Λ^2 M_π^2 ?\n\nActually λ(s,m1^2,m2^2) where s=M_Xi^2. Use s = M_Xi^2 =1.69. Then λ = s^2 + m1^4 + m2^4 -2s m1^2 -2s m2^2 -2 m1^2 m2^2.\n\nLet's compute numbers:\n\ns^2 = (1.69)^2 = 2.8561\nm1^4 = (1.21)^2 = 1.4641\nm2^4 = (0.0196)^2 ≈ 0.00038416\n\nSum = 2.8561+1.4641+0.000384≈4.320584\n\nNow subtract terms:\n2 s m1^2 = 2 *1.69*1.21 = 2*2.0449 =4.0898\n2 s m2^2 = 2*1.69*0.0196 = 2*0.033124 =0.066248\n2 m1^2 m2^2 = 2*1.21*0.0196 = 2*0.023716 =0.047432\n\nTotal subtractions = 4.0898+0.066248+0.047432 = 4.20348\n\nThus λ = 4.320584 - 4.20348 = 0.117104 approx.\n\nThen p* = sqrt(λ)/ (2 M_Xi) .\n\nsqrt(λ) = sqrt(0.117104) ≈ 0.3422.\n\nDivide by 2*M_Xi = 2*1.3 = 2.6 → p* = 0.3422 / 2.6 = 0.13162 GeV/c.\n\nSo each daughter has momentum magnitude ~0.132 GeV/c in CM, opposite directions.\n\nEnergy of Λ in CM: E*_Λ = sqrt(p*^2 + M_Λ^2 ) = sqrt(0.01733 + 1.21) = sqrt(1.22733) = 1.10878 GeV.\n\nSimilarly π: E*_π = sqrt(p*^2 + M_π^2) = sqrt(0.01733 + 0.0196) = sqrt(0.03693) = 0.1922 GeV.\n\nCheck sum: 1.10878+0.1922 = 1.30098 close to M_Xi (1.3) good.\n\nNow transform to lab frame where Xi had velocity β along +x. Compute γ = E_Xi/M_Xi = 2.386/1.3 = 1.83538. Also β = p/E = 2/2.386 = 0.8387. Indeed γ = 1/sqrt(1-β²); check: √(1-β²)=√(1-0.7034)=√0.2966=0.5446 ; 1/0.5446=1.836 matches.\n\nDefine coordinate: In CM, choose X' axis aligned with boost (+x). Daughter Λ emitted at polar angle θ*=30°, azimuth φ maybe zero (in plane). Momentum components in CM:\n\np*_Λ_x = p* cosθ* = 0.13162 * cos30° = 0.13162 * 0.866025 = 0.11396 GeV.\np*_Λ_y = p* sinθ* = 0.13162 * sin30° = 0.13162 * 0.5 = 0.06581 GeV.\nAssume z out of plane not used.\n\nFor pion, it's back-to-back: momentum vector opposite: p*_π = -p*_Λ (since equal magnitude opposite). So components: p*_π_x = -0.11396 , p*_π_y = -0.06581.\n\nNow Lorentz transformation to lab (boost along x):\n\nE_lab = γ(E_* + β p*_x)\np_x_lab = γ(p*_x + β E_*)\np_y_lab = p*_y (unchanged).\n\nDo for Λ:\n\nE*_Λ = 1.10878, p*_x = 0.11396, β=0.8387, γ=1.835.\n\nCalculate term β p*_x = 0.8387*0.11396 = 0.09558.\n\nE_lab_Λ = γ*(1.10878 + 0.09558) = 1.835 * 1.20436 = 2.209 GeV.\n\np_x_lab_Λ = γ*(p*_x + β E*) = γ*(0.11396 + 0.8387*1.10878).\nCompute β E*: 0.8387*1.10878 = 0.9295.\nAdd p*: 0.11396+0.9295 = 1.04346.\nMultiply by γ: 1.835*1.04346 = 1.914 GeV.\n\np_y_lab_Λ = p*_y = 0.06581 GeV.\n\nNow find magnitude |p| = sqrt(px^2+py^2) = sqrt(1.914^2 + 0.0658^2) ≈ sqrt(3.664 + 0.00433) = sqrt(3.6683) = 1.915 GeV/c roughly (makes sense dominated by px). Angle relative to x-axis: tanφ = py/px = 0.06581/1.914 = 0.0344 -> φ ≈ 1.97 degrees upward.\n\nAlso verify energy consistency: E^2 - p^2 should equal M^2: E^2 = 2.209^2 = 4.878; p^2 = 1.915^2 = 3.669; difference = 1.209 ≈ M_Λ^2 (=1.21).

Are any experimental details or assumptions crucial to this suggestion?", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to give transformation properties:\n\nParity P flips spatial coordinates: r -> -r; momenta p is vector => changes sign: p → −p. Spin s is axial vector (pseudo-vector): does not change sign under parity (remains same). Under time reversal T: t→−t, velocities reverse so p → −p. Spin behaves like angular momentum which reverses direction under time reversal? Actually angular momentum L = r × p transforms as L → L because both r unchanged? Wait under T, positions stay same but momenta invert, thus L = r×p goes to -(r×p)? Let's check: r(t) becomes r(-t); derivative dr/dt changes sign, so velocity v-> -v, hence p-> -p. So L = r×p -> r×(-p)= -L . However spin is intrinsic angular momentum, also odd under T: it changes sign. But there may be subtle phase factor i etc. Usually under T, spin operators transform with extra complex conjugation leading to S → -S. Yes.\n\nThus (a):\n\nUnder Parity:\n\\(\\hat P\\, \\mathbf{p}\\,\\hat P^{-1}= -\\mathbf{p},\\)\n\\(\\hat P\\, \\mathbf{s}\\,\\hat P^{-1}=+\\mathbf{s}.\\)\n\nUnder Time-reversal:\n\\(\\hat T\\, \\mathbf{p}\\,\\hat T^{-1}= -\\mathbf{p},\\)\n\\(\\hat T\\, \\mathbf{s}\\,\\hat T^{-1}= -\\mathbf{s}.\\)\n\nAlso note that T is antiunitary causing additional complex conjugation, but we can just state signs.\n\nPart (b): For Λ → N + π decay, one could examine correlation between polarization of initial Lambda (spin direction) and momenta of outgoing particles. Since under T, triple product involving spins and momenta changes sign. A typical observable is the asymmetry parameter α measuring distribution of proton relative to lambda spin: dΓ ∝ 1+α \\(\\vec{S}_Λ·\\hat{p}_N\\). This term is allowed if parity violated (which it is). To test T violation, consider comparing process with its inverse or constructing T-odd correlations such as \\(\\vec{S}_Λ · (\\vec{p}_N × \\vec{p}_π)\\) or \\((\\vec{S}_Λ × \\vec{p}_N )·\\vec{p}_π\\). Because under T each vector flips sign, these scalar triple products change sign ⇒ they are T-odd observables. If CPT holds, then non-zero value indicates CP violation too.\n\nIn practice, measure transverse polarization of the nucleon perpendicular to decay plane when the parent Λ is unpolarized. The expectation value ⟨\\(\\vec{σ}_N·( \\vec{p}_Λ × \\vec{p}_π )⟩\\) should vanish unless T is broken (or final-state interactions mimic effect). Need control over strong/FSI phases – require that no final-state interaction induced fake T-odd effects. Use self-analyzing decays where Λ polarization can be measured via subsequent weak decay (e.g., Λ → p π⁻). Also assume CPT invariance, neglect absorptive parts.\n\nSo propose measurement of T-odd correlation e.g.:\n\n\\(A_T = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\vec{S}_Λ·(\\vec{p}_N × \\vec{p}_π)>0)-\\Gamma(...<0)}{\\Gamma_{total}}\\).\n\nIf nonzero beyond expected from FSI, evidence for TRV.\n\nCrucial experimental aspects: ability to produce polarized Λ beams or determine their spin orientation through analyzing power; precise reconstruction of three-momenta; control of systematic biases; knowledge of possible final‑state interaction phases (strong rescattering) which can generate apparent T‑odd signals even without genuine T violation. Assuming CPT symmetry allows inference about CP violation.\n\nNow craft final answer with LaTeX box.assistantfinal**(a)   Transformation laws**\n\nThe action of the discrete symmetries on the ordinary (true) vectors **p** (linear momentum) and on the axial (pseudo) vectors **s** (spin) follows directly from how space–time coordinates behave.\n\n| Operator | Effect on the coordinate \\( {\\bf x}(t) \\) | Consequence for \\({\\bf p}\\) | Consequence for \\({\\bf s}\\) |\n|----------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Parity \\(\\displaystyle \\hat P:\\;(t,{\\bf x})\\to (t,-{\\bf x})\\) | \\({\\bf x}\\to-{\\bf x}\\) , \\(\\dot{{\\bf x}}=d{\\bf x}/dt\\to-\\dot{{\\bf x}}\\) | \\({\\bf p}=m\\dot{{\\bf x}}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\; \\boxed{{\\bf p}\\xrightarrow[]{\\hat P}{\\bf p}'=-{\\bf p}}\\) | Spin is an *axial* vector : \\({\\bf s}\\equiv{\\bf J}_{\\rm int}\\) does **not** acquire a minus sign under inversion \\(\\boxed{{\\bf s}\\xrightarrow[]{\\hat P}{\\bf s}'={\\bf s}}\\) |\n\n| Operator | Effect on the coordinate \\( {\\bf x}(t) \\) | Consequence for \\({\\bf p}\\) | Consequence for \\({\\bf s}\\) |\n|----------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Time‑reversal \\(\\displaystyle \\hat T:\\;(t,{\\bf x})\\to (-t,{\\bf x})\\) | \\({\\bf x}(t)\\to{\\bf x}(-t)\\) while \\(\\dot{{\\bf x}}(t)\\to -\\dot{{\\bf x}}(-t)\\) (velocities reverse) | \\({\\bf p}=m\\dot{{\\bf x}}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\; \\boxed{{\\bf p}\\xrightarrow[]{\\hat T}{\\bf p}'=-{\\bf p}}\\) | Intrinsic angular momentum changes sign exactly as orbital angular momentum does: \\({\\bf s}\\xrightarrow[]{\\hat T}{\\bf s}'=-{\\bf s}\\) (the anti‑unitarity of \\(\\hat T\\) adds only overall complex‑conjugation factors). |\n\nHence  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\hat P:{\\bf p}\\to-{\\bf p},\\qquad &&\\hat P:{\\bf s}\\to+{\\bf s},\\\\[2mm]\n&\\hat T:{\\bf p}\\to-{\\bf p},\\qquad &&\\hat T:{\\bf s}\\to-{\\bf s}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(b)   Searching for time‑reversal violation in  \n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda\\!\\to\\!

Need identify each particle: muon (negative), electron (negatively charged lepton), antineutrino electron-type, neutrino muon-type.\n\nExplain that it's weak interaction mediated by W boson etc.\n\nPart (b): Mu minus decays at rest producing electron, anti-electron-neutrino, muon-neutrino. Can any lepton from this decay (electron or neutrinos?) interact with a stationary proton converting it to neutron via inverse beta process p+e^- -> n + ν_e ? Actually capture: electron can combine with proton to form neutron plus electron neutrino if sufficient energy (mass difference). The Q-value is about -0.782 MeV (needs input). In free space, electron capture requires kinetic energy >1.293 MeV mass difference between neutron and proton (~1.293 MeV) but also includes binding energies. For free proton capturing electron: p + e− → n + ν_e ; threshold kinetic energy ~ m_n - m_p - m_e = 939.565 -938.272 -0.511 ≈ 0.782 MeV needed as kinetic energy of incoming electron (or center-of-mass). So we ask whether leptons produced have enough kinetic energy. Decay at rest gives total available kinetic energy equal to muon rest mass minus sum masses of products: m_mu=105.658 MeV/c^2, m_e=0.511 MeV, neutrinos negligible. Energy shared among three bodies; typical electron spectrum up to max around 52.8 MeV (half muon mass less small corrections). Indeed maximum electron kinetic energy approx (m_mu/2)*(1 - (m_e/m_mu)^2 ) ≈ 53 MeV. That's far above 0.78 MeV, so yes possible. However probability low because they go isotropically away; cross-section for e-p scattering leading to conversion is tiny due to weak interaction. Also neutrinos could induce reactions like ν_e + p → n + e+, requiring Eν>1.806 MeV (threshold). Muon-decay neutrinos have spectra up to ~50 MeV, thus some exceed threshold.

Similarly ν_e not present; only ν̅_e cannot cause p→n, but ν_μ can't either. Only electron works.

So pion has l=0 relative motion with respect to nucleus. Deuteron is ^3 S1 meaning two nucleons (p,n) coupled to total J=1, L=0, S=1 (triplet). The overall initial total angular momentum includes deuteron spin 1 plus maybe orbital between pion and deuteron? Since pion in s-state (lπd=0), so total J_i = 1 (from deuteron).\n\nFinal state: two neutrons. Need to conserve total angular momentum (including orbital between them and intrinsic spins). Also parity conservation.\n\nNeutrons identical fermions => total wavefunction antisymmetric under exchange. Spatial part * spin-isospin part must be antisymmetric.\n\nIsospin: Neutron is I=½, third component -½. Two-neutron system total isospin T=1 (since symmetric combination gives T=1, while T=0 would be pn). For nn, only T=1 allowed (symmetric in isospin). Therefore isospin part symmetric.\n\nThus combined spin*spatial must be antisymmetric. Spin states: singlet S=0 (antisymmetric) or triplet S=1 (symmetric). To get overall antisymmetry given isospin symmetric, we require spatial*spin antisymmetric -> if spin symmetric (S=1) then spatial must be antisymmetric (odd L); if spin antisymmetric (S=0) then spatial symmetric (even L).\n\nNow consider parity: Initial parity = product of parities: deuteron internal parity (+?) nuclear ground state positive parity because L=0. Pion negative parity (intrinsic). Bound state orbital l=0 contributes factor (-1)^l =+1. So overall initial parity = (+)*(–)= – . Final parity: each neutron intrinsic parity +1, times orbital factor (-1)^L. Thus overall parity = (-1)^L. Must equal initial parity (conserved): (-1)^L = – ⇒ L odd. Hence L must be odd. That forces spatial antisymmetric, thus spin symmetric S=1. So answer:\n\n(a) Orbital angular momentum L = 1 (or could be higher odd values?). Lowest possible consistent with selection rules likely L=1 (P-wave). Could also have L=3 etc., but dominant low-energy will be minimal L=1. So answer: L=1 (P-wave).\n\n(b) Total spin S = 1 (triplet).\n\n(c) Probability for both neutron spins directed opposite the spin of the deuteron. Initially deuteron spin orientation defines quantization axis k. After reaction, total spin S=1 can have magnetic substates m_S = +1,0,-1 along same axis. We want configuration where both neutron spins are opposite to deuteron spin direction. Deuteron spin presumably aligned +k (say up). Opposite means each neutron spin down (i.e., projection -1/2 each). Combined they give total M_s = -1 (sum of projections). In triplet basis |S=1,m=-1> corresponds to both spins down. So probability amplitude squared for being in m=-1 substate given unpolarized distribution? But since initial deuteron was fully polarized, transition amplitudes depend on Clebsch-Gordan coupling of initial J=1,m=+1 (?) Actually deuteron spin is +1 along k (fully polarized). Capture process conserves total J_z: initial Jz = +1 (deuteron) + pion's mj=0 (since l=0). So final Jz = +1 must equal sum of orbital ml + spin ms_total. With L=1, ml can be -1,0,+1. And S=1, ms can be -1,0,+1 such that ml+ms = +1.\n\nWe ask probability that both neutron spins point opposite to deuteron (so ms_total = -1). Then required ml = +2 ? Wait ml must satisfy ml + ms = +1. If ms = -1, then ml = +2, not allowed as max ml for L=1 is +1. Therefore this channel impossible! Hmm perhaps they mean \"both neutron spins opposite the spin of the deuteron\" individually, regardless of total J constraint? Let's think again: The question (c) asks probability for finding both neutron spins directed opposite the spin of the deuteron. This seems like asking within the final spin-triplet state, what's the fraction of configurations where both spins anti-aligned vs other possibilities. Without considering orbital constraints, the three triplet components equally probable? However due to angular momentum coupling with L=1, probabilities differ depending on ml contributions weighted by spherical harmonic Y_{LM}. Might lead to anisotropic distribution later.\n\nBut part (c) might just refer to statistical weight of the m=-1 component among the three possible spin orientations when no external polarization considered beyond deuteron spin alignment. Yet initial deuteron spin fixed leads to certain mixture determined by CG coefficients linking initial J=1,m=+1 to final LS coupling. Compute using addition of L=1 and S=1 to make total J=1 (same as initial). Coupling scheme: combine L and S to produce total J=1. Use Clebsch Gordan: |J=1,M=+1⟩ expressed as Σ C(LM_L,S M_S|JM) |L M_L⟩|S M_S⟩. Here L=S=1. Coefficients needed for M=+1.\n\nThe relevant combinations:\nM_L = +1, M_S = 0   coefficient C(1,1;1,0|1,1)\nM_L = 0 , M_S = +1  coeff C(1,0;1,1|1,1)\n\nAlso possibly M_L = +2?? Not exist. So only these two terms contribute. No term with M_S = -1. Therefore probability of both spins down (M_S=-1) is zero. So answer (c) = 0%.\n\nThat makes sense physically: cannot have both neutron spins antiparallel to original deuteron spin due to angular momentum conservation.\n\nThus (c) probability = 0.\n\nPart (d): Angular dependence of neutron emission probability per unit solid angle for a neutron whose spin is opposite to that of the initial deuteron. Now we look at case where one neutron spin is opposite? Or they say \"for a neutron whose spin is opposite to that of the initial deuteron\". Means pick one neutron, measure its spin direction opposite to deuteron spin (i.e., spin-down). Given the pair is in triplet with correlated spins, there are cases where individual neutron can be opposite even though total Ms differs. Need compute differential rate proportional to |amplitude|² summed over partner degrees.\n\nFrom earlier decomposition: Amplitudes correspond to two terms:\n\nTerm A: ML=+1, MS=0 (overall M=+1). Here spin state MS=0 corresponds to superposition (|↑↓〉+|↓↑〉)/√2. Both neutrons symmetrically oriented; each has 50% chance to be ↓.\n\nTerm B: ML=0, MS=+1 corresponding to spin state |↑↑〉 (both up). No neutron opposite.\n\nTherefore detection of a neutron with spin down selects contribution from Term A only. Its angular dependence comes from associated spherical harmonic Y_{1}^{+1}(θ,φ) ∝ - sin θ e^{i φ}. Intensity ~ |Y_{1}^{+1}|² ∝ sin²θ.\n\nNormalization constant aside. So probability per solid angle ∝ sin²θ.\n\nHence answer: W(θ) ∝ sin²θ (independent of φ after averaging over azimuthal symmetry? Actually intensity depends on φ via magnitude square eliminates phase, giving sin²θ independent of φ.)\n\nSo final answers:\n\n(a) L = 1 (P‑wave).\n(b) S = 1 (triplet).\n(c) Zero probability.\n(d) Differential probability \\( \\frac{dW}{dΩ}\\propto \\sin^{2}\\theta\\).

Detailed balance states that transition rates per unit volume equal when equilibrium holds: w_ab->cd = w_cd->ab . Rate = n_a n_b <σ v> etc. In CM frame, differential cross-section relates as:\n\ndσ_{i→f}/dΩ = (|p_f| / |p_i| ) ( (2S_f+1)/ (2S_i+1) ) dσ_{f→i}/dΩ .\n\nIntegrating over angles gives similar ratio.\n\nThus we have:\n\nσ_{II}= (|k_\\gamma|^2 / |k_{\\pi}|^2?) Wait momenta: Reaction I: γ(particle) + p → π⁺ + n. Initial particles: photon (spin 1 but only transverse polarizations; average over 2 helicities), proton spin ½ (average over 2). Final: pion spin0, neutron spin½ (sum over 2).\n\nReaction II reverse: π⁺ + n → γ + p. Initial: pion spin0 (no averaging), neutron spin½ (avg over 2); final: photon spin1 (two polarisations sum?), proton spin½ (sum over 2). Need proper statistical factor g= (2s+1). So general expression:\n\nσ_{π n →γ p }(W)= ( (2 S_γ+1)(2 S_p+1) / ((2 S_π+1)(2 S_n+1))) × (|p_{γ}^{*}|^{2})/(|p_{π}^{*}|^{2}) × σ_{γ p →π n}(W)\n\nwhere p_* denote magnitude of CMS momentum of each channel.\n\nPhoton has 2 polarization states => g_γ=2. Pion spin0 => g_π=1. Proton/neutron both spin½ => g_N=2.\n\nSo prefactor = (2×2)/(1×2)=2.\n\nNow momentum magnitudes: In CM, for reaction I, incoming photon momentum k = (W² - m²)/(2W)? Actually for massless particle plus massive target: s=W²=(E_γ+E_p)^2-(p_γ+p_p)^2 ; In CM, energies E*_γ = (W² - m²)/(2W) because photon mass zero, so its momentum equals its energy: |k| = E*_γ = (W² - m²)/(2W). Similarly outgoing pion momentum q = λ^(1/2)(W²,m_π²,m²)/(2W) where λ(x,y,z)=x²+y²+z²-2xy-2xz-2yz.\n\nFor reverse process, initial pion momentum is same q, final photon momentum is k.\n\nTherefore ratio |k|/|q| appears squared? Let's recall formula includes ratio of velocities or fluxes: Flux ∝ relative velocity times product of densities. For two-body, flux factor F = 4|p_i|√((p_i·...?). But standard result: σ_{12→34}= ( (2J3+1)(2J4+1) / ( (2J1+1)(2J2+1) )) * (p_{34}^2/p_{12}^2) * σ_{34→12}. Yes square of momentum ratio.\n\nHence:\n\nσ_{II}(W)= 2 * (k^2/q^2) * σ_I(W).\n\nWhere k = (W² - m²)/(2W), q = sqrt([W² -(m+μ)²][W²-(m-μ)²]) /(2W).\n\nSimplify maybe write explicit.\n\nPart (b): Threshold for reaction II occurs when W = m+ μ (minimum invariant mass needed to produce photon + proton from pi+n? Wait reverse: π⁺ + n -> γ + p. Since photon massless, minimal W corresponds to final state having minimum possible total energy i.e., when photon carries away any extra kinetic energy; but conservation requires W >= m (proton mass) + 0? However initial system already contains pion mass μ plus neutron mass m, so W_min = m+μ (when they are at rest relative). That's also the same as threshold for forward reaction. At this threshold, outgoing photon momentum goes to zero? Actually at threshold for reverse, the final photon can carry arbitrarily low energy while proton recoils such that total cm energy fixed. Minimum photon energy tends to zero, which implies final-state momentum of photon approaches zero, thus momentum transfer small. Near threshold, q ≈ √[(W-(m+μ))(W+(m-μ))/...] approximates something linear in sqrt(W-W_th). Meanwhile k ~ (W² - m²)/(2W) evaluated near threshold yields finite non-zero? Compute at W=m+μ: k_thr = [(m+μ)² - m²]/[2(m+μ)] = [m²+2mμ+μ² - m²] /[2(m+μ)] = (2mμ+μ²)/[2(m+μ)] = μ(2m+μ)/[2(m+μ)]. Nonzero.\n\nThus near threshold, q behaves like √(λ)/2W where λ≈ (W-(m+μ))*something linear. Specifically λ = [W²-(m+μ)²][W²-(m-μ)²]; first term vanishes linearly, second approx constant ~( (m+μ)+(m-μ) )( (m+μ)-(m-μ) )?? compute at threshold: W=m+μ then second bracket = (m+μ)²-(m-μ)² = ... let's approximate derivative leads to proportionality to (W-(m+μ)). Hence q∝√(W-W_thresh). Therefore σ_II ∝ (k^2/q^2)*σ_I. Assuming σ_I varies smoothly near threshold (maybe not singular), main variation comes from 1/q^2 diverging as 1/(W-W_thresh). Thus σ_II rises sharply as 1/(W-W_thresh) just above threshold.\n\nMore precisely, since σ_I itself near threshold behaves like q (phase-space) perhaps? For photoproduction, σ_I ∼ q/k ??? Not sure. But question likely expects statement: σ_II ∝ (k^2/q^2) σ_I, and near threshold q~sqrt(W-Wthr) leading to σ_II ∝ 1/(W-Wthr) if σ_I regular. Or could say it grows as (W-W_thr)^{-1/2}? Let's think: If σ_I behaves like q (since final pion momentum enters phase space), typical behavior near threshold for production of massive particle is σ ∝ q (or q³ depending angular momentum). For s-wave, σ ∝ q/k? Actually photoproduction amplitude may be smooth, cross section ∝ q/k due to phase space factor. Then σ_I ∝ q/k. Plug into σ_II =2(k^2/q^2) σ_I ⇒ ∝2(k^2/q^2)*(q/k)=2k/q. Since k finite, σ_II ∝ 1/q ∝ 1/sqrt(W-W_thr).

What energy must a single proton have to give the same center-of-mass energy when colliding with a stationary proton? ", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to compute COM energy sqrt(s) for two beams each 30 GeV (total energy includes rest mass). Proton rest mass m_p ≈0.938272 GeV.\n\nGiven two protons moving opposite directions each with total energy E_beam = 30 GeV. The invariant s = (p1 + p2)^2 c^2? In natural units c=1. For identical masses:\n\ns = 2m^2 + 2E1 E2 - 2|p1||p2|\\cosθ . For head on θ=π => cosθ=-1 so term becomes +2 |p1||p2| because minus times negative gives plus? Let's derive properly: four-momenta: p1=(E,p), p2=(E,-p). Then sum squared: (E+E)^2 -(p-p)^2 = (2E)^2 - 0 =4E^2. So s =4E^2 where E is total energy per beam. Wait check: using metric (+---): s = (p1+p2)^2 = (E1+E2)^2 - (\\vec p_1+\\vec p_2)^2. Since momenta cancel, we get (2E)^2 =4E^2. Good. Therefore √s = 2E = 60 GeV. That's the CM energy available.\n\nNow consider fixed target: one proton at rest (energy=m), other moving with unknown total energy E_lab. Compute s = m^2 + m^2 + 2 m E_lab (since p_target = (m,0)). Actually formula: s = m^2 + m^2 + 2 m E_{lab}. Because p1·p2 = E_lab * m (dot product). Using natural units: s = 2m^2 + 2 m E_lab.\n\nSet √s equal to 60 GeV. Square both sides: s = (60)^2 =3600 GeV^2.\n\nThus solve: 2m^2 + 2 m E_lab = 3600 → divide 2: m^2 + m E_lab =1800.\n\nPlug m≈0.9383 GeV. Compute m^2 ~0.880. So equation: 0.880 + 0.9383*E_lab =1800 ⇒ 0.9383 E_lab =1799.12 ⇒ E_lab ≈1917 GeV.\n\nSo required lab total energy about 1.92 TeV. Usually they ask kinetic energy maybe; but question says \"What energy must a single proton have\". Likely total energy including rest mass. Could also present as kinetic energy approx 1.916 TeV (subtract rest mass).\n\nLet's calculate more precisely: Use m=0.93827 GeV.\n\nCompute via python mental: 1800 - m^2 = 1800 - 0.880... = 1799.1196. Divide by m: 1799.1196 / 0.93827 = ?\n\nApprox: 0.94 goes into 1799 roughly 1915. But let's do precise: 0.93827*1900 = 1782.73 ; remainder 16.39 ; extra 17.48/0.93827 ≈18.6 ; total 1918.6. Slight adjust. Let's compute better: 1799.1196 / 0.93827.\n\nTake reciprocal of denominator: 1/0.93827 ≈1.06578. Multiply: 1799.1196 *1.06578 ≈ 1917.9. So around 1.918 TeV.\n\nTherefore answer: approximately 1.9 TeV total energy (~1.9 ×10³ GeV).

So a single strange particle could decay via weak interaction into non-strange products, e.g., K+ → μ+ νμ or ππ etc? Actually kaon has S=+1, decays weakly to pions (S=0). That's allowed because weak interaction does not conserve strangeness. So statement (a): yes, possible through weak decay. So true.\n\nStatement (b): Strong creation requires initial total strangeness zero -> final also zero due to conservation. Therefore you can't create a net strangeness from nothing via strong interaction. However pair production like s anti-s yields overall zero strangeness, but that would produce two strange particles (one with +1, other -1), not just one. So creating a single strange particle strongly from zero strangeness violates strangeness conservation. Thus false.\n\nStatement (c): No, such states do exist (e.g., Kaons, hyperons).

So roughly fine structure constant inverse α⁻¹~137. Indeed relation a0 = λ_bar /α . Since α≈1/137 => a0 ≈ 137*λ_bar. Thus compared to electron Compton wavelength (reduced), it's about 100 times larger (actually 137). Options given: 100 times larger, 1000 times larger, about same.

{"id": "atomic/4-17", "questions": "Determine the threshold energy for a gamma ray to create an electron-positron pair in an interaction with an electron at rest.  ", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to find minimum photon (gamma) energy required to produce e+e− pair when interacting with stationary electron (i.e., γ + e⁻ → e⁺ + e⁻ + e⁻). This is triplet production? Actually it's \"pair production on an electron\" which yields three particles: original electron recoils plus created e+e-. Threshold condition from conservation of energy-momentum.\n\nIn lab frame where target electron initially at rest. Let initial four-momenta:\n\nPhoton: pγ = (E_γ/c , E_γ/c * n̂ ) but magnitude |p|=E_γ /c.\n\nElectron at rest: pe_i = (m_e c, 0).\n\nFinal state: three electrons/positrons total mass: two electrons + one positron => total rest mass = 3 m_e . At threshold all final particles move together with same velocity so minimal kinetic energy; i.e., they have zero relative momentum in center-of-mass frame -> in lab frame they share common velocity such that total momentum equals initial photon's momentum.\n\nThus we can use invariant s = (pγ + pe)^2. Minimum occurs when final system has total invariant mass equal to sum masses: M_f = 3 m_e. So compute s_min = (3 m_e c^2)^2 .\n\nCompute s = (pγ + pe)^2 = pγ^2 + pe^2 + 2 pγ·pe. Photon null: pγ^2 = 0. Electron rest: pe^2 = (m_ec)^2 (actually (mc)^2?). In natural units c=1, then pe^2=m_e^2. Keep using c.\n\nSo s = m_e^2 c^4 + 2 pγ·pe.\n\nNow dot product: pγ·pe = (E_γ/c)(m_e c) - (vector part)*(0)= E_γ m_e . Because pe spatial component zero. So pγ·pe = E_γ m_e.\n\nTherefore s = m_e^2 c^4 + 2 E_γ m_e c^2 ?\n\nWait dimensions: Use energy squared: s = (total energy)^2 - (total momentum c)^2. Using standard formula: (pγ + pe)^2 = m_e^2 c^4 + 2 E_γ m_e c^2 . Yes because pγ·pe = E_γ m_e c^2? Let's check: Four-vector components: pγ = (E_γ/c, \\vec{k}) with |\\vec{k}| = E_γ/c. pe = (m_e c, 0). Dot product: g_{μν} pγ^μ pe^ν = (E_γ/c)(m_e c) - \\vec{k}\\cdot 0 = E_γ m_e . But that's in units of ??? Since each term includes factor of c? Usually four-momentum defined as (E/c, \\vec{p}). Then its square gives (E/c)^2 - p^2 = (m c)^2. So indeed pγ·pe = (E_γ/c)(m_e c) = E_γ m_e . That's dimension of energy*mass. Multiply by c^2 later maybe.\n\nThen s = m_e^2 c^2?? Wait careful: The invariant quantity usually expressed as (energy)^2 - (pc)^2 = (mc^2)^2. If we define four-momentum P = (E/c, \\vec{p}), then P^2 = (E/c)^2 - p^2 = (mc)^2. Multiplying both sides by c^2 gives (E)^2 - (pc)^2 = (mc^2)^2.\n\nThus if we keep using P = (E/c,...), then s = (P_total)^2 = ((E_tot)/c)^2 - p_tot^2 = (M c)^2 where M is total invariant mass.\n\nHence s = (M c)^2. For our case, M = 3 m_e. Therefore s_threshold = (3 m_e c)^2 =9 m_e^2 c^2.\n\nBut earlier expression gave s = m_e^2 c^2 + 2 E_γ m_e ? Need consistent factors.\n\nLet's do it systematically using natural units (c=1). Then four-momentum squares give masses directly. We'll set c=1, restore later.\n\nInitial: k (photon): (E_γ, \\vec{k}) with |k|=E_γ. Rest electron: p=(m_e,0). Total: K=k+p. Square: s = (K)^2 = k^2 + p^2 + 2 k·p = 0 + m_e^2 + 2(E_γ m_e). Thus s = m_e^2 + 2 m_e E_γ.\n\nThreshold requires s = (sum masses)^2 = (3 m_e)^2 = 9 m_e^2.\n\nSet equality: m_e^2 + 2 m_e E_thr = 9 m_e^2 ⇒ 2 m_e E_thr = 8 m_e^2 ⇒ E_thr = 4 m_e.\n\nRestoring c: Energy unit: m_e c^2 ≈511 keV. So E_thr = 4 m_e c^2 = 4 × 511 keV = 2044 keV ≈ 2.04 MeV.\n\nThus threshold ~ 2.044 MeV.\n\nCheck known result: Pair production on free electron (triplet production) threshold about 4 m_e c^2 = 2.044 MeV.

It is interpreted as a bound state of a charm quark and its antiquark (\\(c\\bar c\\)), i.e. the ground‑state vector charmonium.\n\n*Why it was revolutionary* – Its narrow width (\\(\\Gamma\\simeq93\\,{\\rm keV}\\)) indicated a surprisingly long lifetime for a hadron of this mass, signalling that strong decays were OZI‑suppressed because the decay would have to create light‑quark pairs from the heavy \\(c\\bar c\\) pair. This “November Glashow” discovery gave direct evidence for a fourth flavour of quark and inaugurated the era of heavy‑flavour spectroscopy.\n\n*Key phenomenology* – Production occurs via:\n  * \\(e^+ e^- \\to J/\\psi\\) (resonant formation),\n  * Hadronic collisions through gluon fusion,\n  * B‑meson decays \\(B\\to J/\\psi X\\).\n\nIts leptonic branching fraction,\n\\[\n\\mathcal B(J/\\psi\\to \\ell^+\\ell^-)\\approx 6\\% ,\n\\]\nprovides a clean experimental tag used today in studies of CP violation and QCD factorisation.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Neutral kaon system and regeneration of \\(K_S\\)\n\nThe weak eigenstates \\(|K^0\\rangle(d\\bar s)\\) and |\\(\\overline{K}^{0}\\rangle(s\\bar d)\\) mix under second‑order weak interactions.

Experimentally one observes an interference pattern in the downstream decay distribution, which historically provided the first precise measurement of the CP‑violating parameter \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM)\n\nA permanent electric dipole moment \\({\\bf d}_n\\) aligned with the spin violates both parity (P) and time‑reversal (T) symmetries; assuming CPT invariance, it also signals CP violation beyond the Standard Model (SM). In the SM the predicted value is tiny,\n\n\\[\nd_n^{\\text{SM}}\\lesssim10^{-31}\\;e\\cdot{\\rm cm},\n\\]\n\nwhereas many extensions (supersymmetry, left‑right models, axion‑like sectors) predict values up to \\(10^{-26}-10^{-28}\\;e\\cdot{\\rm cm}\\).\n\nExperimental technique: ultra‑cold neutrons are stored in a chamber subjected to parallel (or anti‑parallel) uniform magnetic \\((\\mathbf B)\\) and electric \\((\\mathbf E)\\) fields.

However also there are other decay modes for τ (to μ νν, hadrons). Branching ratio Br(τ→e νν)=0.16 means this channel accounts for 16% of total τ decays. So we can write partial width Γ_e = Br * Γ_total. Assuming same dynamics as muon decay, then Γ_e ≈ Γ_mu × (m_τ/m_μ)^5 . Then solve for total τ lifetime: τ_tau = ħ/Γ_total = ħ/(Γ_e /Br ) = (ħ/Γ_mu)*(1/((m_τ/m_μ)^5*Br)). Since τ_mu known: τ_mu=2.2×10⁻⁶ s. So τ_tau = τ_mu /( (m_τ/m_μ)^5 * Br ). Compute numbers.\n\nFirst compute ratio r=m_τ/m_μ = 1784/106≈? Let's calculate precisely: 106 MeV => 1784/106 = 16.83018868 approx 16.83.\n\nNow r^5 = (16.83)^5. Use logs or successive multiplication.\n\nCompute square: r² ~283.3 (since 16.8^2=282.24). More precise: 16.83019^2 = 283.33.\n\nr³ = r² * r = 283.33*16.830 = about 4769 (since 283*17~4811). Let's compute: 283.33*16.830 = 283.33*(16 +0.83) = 4533.28 +235.16 ≈ 4768.44.\n\nr⁴ = r³ * r = 4768.44*16.830 ≈ let's do 4768.44*16 = 76295 ; plus 0.83*4768.44 ≈3957.8 ; sum ≈80253. Approx more accurate: multiply by 0.830... Actually 0.830 = difference from 16? Wait 16.830 = 16 +0.830. Already did 16 part. Add 0.830*4768.44 = 3960.80. Sum = 80255.8.\n\nSo r⁴ ≈ 8.03×10⁴.\n\nr⁵ = r⁴ * r = 8.0256e4 * 16.830 ≈ 8.0256e4*16 = 1.2841e6 ; plus 0.830*8.0256e4 = 66613 ; total ≈ 1.3507e6. So roughly 1.35 million.\n\nThus (m_τ/m_μ)^5 ≈ 1.35×10⁶.\n\nNow include branching ratio Br=0.16. Multiply: 1.35e6 * 0.16 = 216000 ≈ 2.16×10⁵.\n\nThen τ_tau = τ_mu / (2.16×10⁵) = 2.2×10⁻⁶ s / 2.16×10⁵ = (2.2/2.16)*10^{ -6 -5 }? Wait dividing by 2.16e5 multiplies exponent -5? Actually 10⁻⁶ divided by 10⁵ gives 10⁻¹¹. So result around 1.02×10⁻11 s. Let's compute numeric: 2.2/2.16 ≈ 1.0185. Times 10⁻¹¹ → 1.02×10⁻11 s.\n\nExperimental actual tau lifetime is about 2.9×10⁻13 s. Our estimate seems off by two orders magnitude! Did I mis-handle branching fraction? The total width includes all possible decays; our calculation gave too long lifetime because we used only one mode's width scaled up heavily leading to small total width after division by Br maybe not correct sign?\n\nLet's think: Partial width for τ→e νν should scale like m_τ⁵ (same as muon). So Γ(τ→e) = Γ(mu) * (m_τ/m_μ)^5 . Gamma mu = 1/τ_mu = 1/(2.2e-6) = 4.545e5 per second? Actually that's 4.54e5 s⁻¹. Multiply by 1.35e6 yields Γ(τ→e) ≈ 6.14e11 s⁻¹. That corresponds to a lifetime if it were sole mode: τ_partial = 1/Γ ≈ 1.63e-12 s. Now since this mode constitutes only 16%, the total width larger: Γ_total = Γ_partial / Br = 6.14e11 /0.16 = 3.84e12 s⁻¹. Lifetime = 1/Γ_total = 2.60e-13 s. That's close to real value (~2.9e-13 s). Good! My earlier formula inverted incorrectly. Indeed τ_tau = τ_mu / ((m_τ/m_μ)^5 * Br) ??? Let's test: τ_mu = 2.2e-6 s. Divide by (1.35e6 *0.16) = divide by 2.16e5 giving 1.0e-11 which was wrong. Should instead be τ_tau = τ_mu * ( (m_μ)/(m_τ))^5 * Br ? Let's derive correctly.\n\nGamma_mu = 1/τ_mu.\n\nPartial gamma_tau(e) = Gamma_mu * (m_τ/m_μ)^5 .\n\nTotal gamma_tau = Gamma_tau(partial)/Br = Gamma_mu *(m_τ/m_μ)^5 / Br.\n\nTherefore τ_tau = 1/Gamma_total = τ_mu * (m_μ/m_τ)^5 * Br.\n\nYes that's the right expression: τ_tau = τ_mu * (m_μ/m_τ)^5 * Br.\n\nPlugging values: (m_μ/m_τ)^5 = 1/r^5 = 1/1.35e6 = 7.41e-7. Multiply by Br 0.16 gives 1.186e-7. Multiply by τ_mu 2.2e-6 gives 2.61e-13 s. Great!\n\nHence answer (a): τ_tau ≈ 2.6×10⁻13 s.\n\nPart (b): In lab frame where τ produced with energy E_lab = 29 GeV center-of-mass? At symmetric beams each has 14.5 GeV? But they say \"colliding beam accelerator (like PEP), e+ e− → τ+ τ− at E_em = 29 GeV (e+ and e− have equal and opposite momenta)\" Means total CM energy sqrt(s) = 29 GeV. Production near threshold? Not exactly; tau pair production requires √s > 2*m_τ = 3.568 GeV, far lower than 29 GeV, so taus highly boosted. Each tau gets half of total energy in CM due to symmetry: each carries E_* = √s/2 = 14.5 GeV. Their momentum magnitude p_* = sqrt(E_*^2 - m_τ^2). Compute γ = E_/m_τ. So γ = 14.5 GeV / 1.784 GeV = 8.124. β = sqrt(1-1/γ^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/66) ≈ sqrt(65/66) ≈ 0.992. Mean proper lifetime τ₀ = 2.6e-13 s. Lab mean path L = βγ c τ₀. Using c = 3.00e8 m/s. Compute βγ = sqrt(γ^2-1)?? Actually βγ = sqrt(γ^2-1). With γ=8.124, γ^2=66.0, minus 1 =65, sqrt =8.062. Approximately equals γβ indeed ~8.07.

{"id": "atomic/1-4", "questions": "﻿Estimate the electric field needed to pull an electron out of an atom in a time comparable to that for the electron to go around the nucleus.\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to interpret question: \"Estimate the electric field needed to pull an electron out of an atom in a time comparable to that for the electron to go around the nucleus.\" So we want magnitude of external E such that ionization occurs within one orbital period (i.e., about Bohr orbit). Use classical picture: electron bound with Coulomb force F = e^2/(4π ε0 r^2) ~ binding centripetal force m v^2 /r . For hydrogen ground state radius a0 ≈ 0.53 Å.\n\nTime scale for electron to go around nucleus is orbital period T = 2π r/v. In Bohr model, v≈α c where α=1/137; indeed v~c/137 ≈ 2.19e6 m/s. Compute T = 2π a0 /v. Let's compute numeric later.\n\nNow apply external uniform electric field E which exerts force Fe = eE on electron opposite direction to nuclear attraction. To overcome binding quickly (~one period), net acceleration should cause displacement comparable to atomic size over half-period? Simpler estimate: set work done by field over distance a0 equal to binding energy (13.6 eV). Work W = e E * a0 => E = Ebinding /(e a0). Binding energy = 13.6 eV = 2.18×10^-18 J. a0 = 5.3×10^-11 m. Then E ≈ 2.18e-18 / (1.60e-19*5.3e-11)=?\n\nCompute denominator: e*a0 = 1.602e-19 *5.2918e-11 = approx 8.48e-30 C·m. Numerator 2.18e-18 J. Ratio = 2.58e11 V/m. That's huge ~2×10^{11} V/m.\n\nBut they ask \"in a time comparable to that for the electron to go around the nucleus\". The above uses static field doing work across full separation maybe not incorporate dynamics. Another approach: consider required acceleration a_ext = eE/m_e such that electron gains kinetic energy comparable to binding energy within time τ ~ T. Energy gain ΔK = (1/2)m a^2 t^2? Actually if constant acceleration from rest, velocity after time t: v=a t ; KE =½ m a^2 t^2. Set this equal to binding energy. Solve for E:\n\n(1/2) m (eE/m)^2 t^2 = Eb -> (e^2 E^2)/(2 m) t^2 = Eb → E = sqrt(2 m Eb)/ (e t).\n\nTake t = orbital period T. Need T value: Using Bohr model, angular frequency ω = v/r = (α c)/a0. But also known: orbital period T = 2π ħ³ / (me⁴?) Might just calculate numerically: v = α c = (1/137)*3e8 = 2.19e6 m/s. a0 = 5.29e-11 m. Thus T = 2π a0 / v = 2π *5.29e-11 / 2.19e6 = (3.33e-10) / 2.19e6? Wait compute numerator: 2π a0 = 2*3.1416*5.29e-11 = 3.324e-10 m. Divide by 2.19e6 gives T ≈ 1.52e-16 s. Good.\n\nNow plug numbers: m =9.11e-31 kg, Eb = 2.18e-18 J, e=1.602e-19 C, t=1.5e-16 s.\n\nFirst compute sqrt(2 m Eb): 2*m*Eb = 2*9.11e-31*2.18e-18 = 2* (9.11*2.18)e-49 = (19.86)e-49 ≈1.986e-48. Square root: √1.986e-48 = √1.986 ×10^{-24}. sqrt(1.986)=1.409. So result ≈1.41e-24 kg^{1/2}J^{1/2}? Units produce momentum. Anyway value =1.41e-24.\n\nThen divide by (e t): e*t =1.602e-19 *1.5e-16 =2.403e-35 C·s. Now E = 1.41e-24 / 2.40e-35 = 5.87e10 V/m ≈6×10^{10} V/m.

The Λ (spin 1/2) decaying weakly into proton (spin 1/2) plus pion (spin 0). Parity would dictate angular distribution of daughter particles relative to polarization direction of parent.\n\nIf initial Λ is polarized, then under parity-conserving interaction, the decay amplitude can have S-wave (L=0) and P-wave (L=1) contributions with specific interference leading to asymmetry parameter α = 2 Re(S*P)/( |S|^2+|P|^2 ). Under parity conservation, only one partial wave allowed because total parity product must match; but actually both could appear if they correspond to opposite intrinsic parities? Let's recall: Intrinsic parity of Λ and p same sign (+), π has negative parity (-). So overall parity change requires L odd or even accordingly. For strong interactions parity conserved so selection rule restricts orbital angular momentum. In weak decay parity not necessarily conserved, allowing mixture of S and P waves giving non-zero asymmetry. Test: produce polarized Λ's e.g., via production reaction like pp → K⁺Λ where Λ emerges polarized perpendicular to production plane. Then measure angular distribution of protons in Λ rest frame relative to polarization vector. If parity conserved, distribution symmetric forward-backward => no term linear in cosθ, i.e., asymmetry parameter zero. Observation of asymmetric distribution indicates parity violation.\n\nCircumstances preventing usefulness: If Λ unpolarized, cannot detect asymmetry. Also if detector acceptance symmetrical etc. Or if final state interactions mimic asymmetry? Another issue: Strong final-state interactions might induce phase shifts between S,P making apparent asymmetry even if underlying weak vertex conserves parity? Actually phases cause interference but still require mixing of different parity amplitudes which implies parity violation at fundamental level. However rescattering could generate effective mix? But likely small.\n\nAlso limited statistics, background contamination, depolarization during travel before decay due to magnetic fields.\n\nThus answer: Use measurement of decay parameter α defined as correlation between Λ spin and proton momentum. Nonzero α signals parity violation. Conditions that hinder: Need polarized Λ sample; also need ability to determine spin orientation; any randomizing processes degrade polarization; also if there were equal admixture such that net asymmetry cancels?

Wait actual expression: dΓ/dΩ ∝ 1+α \\cosθ . α ≠0 ⇒ parity violated. Derive based on helicity states.\n\nExplain why parity conservation forces α=0 because S‑wave gives isotropic distribution while P‑wave yields anisotropic but changes sign under parity; without mixing you can't get linear term.\n\nCircumstances: No initial polarization, inability to reconstruct rest frame accurately, presence of strong-interaction induced polarizations, experimental systematic errors.\n\nWill present final answer boxed.assistantfinal### How to test whether the weak decay  \n\n\\[\n\\Lambda^{0}(J=\\tfrac12)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;p(J=\\tfrac12)+\\pi^{-}(J=0)\n\\]\n\nconserves parity  \n\n---\n\n#### 1.

Yes.\n\nm^2 = 106^2 = 11236.\n\nDifference: 244036 - 11236 = 232800.\n\nNow divide by 2M = 2*494 = 988.\n\nSo p = 232800 / 988 ≈ ?\n\nCalculate: 988 *200 =197600 ; remainder 35200 . 988*35 =34580 ; remainder 620. So about 235. So p≈235.3 MeV/c.\n\nLet's compute more accurately: Use division: 232800/988.\n\nFirst approximate: 988*236 = 988*(200+30+6) = 197600 +29640 +5928 =233168. Slightly above 232800. Try 235.7: 988*235.7 = 988*235 + 988*0.7 = 231... Actually 988*235 = 988*(200+30+5) =197600+29640+4940=232180. Add 0.7*988=691.6 gives 232871.6 close. Need 232800 so maybe 235.66. Good enough ~235.6 MeV.\n\nThus muon total energy E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m^2) = M - p = 494 - p ≈ 258.4 MeV.\n\nCheck: 494 - 235.6 = 258.4 MeV.\n\nAlternatively compute via formula: E_mu = (M^2 + m^2)/ (2M). Indeed from two-body kinematics with one massless product: E_mu = (M^2 + m^2)/(2M). Compute: (244036 +11236)/(988) =255272/988 ≈?\n\nWait sum: 244036+11236=255272. Divide by 988: 988*258 =254,... 988*258 = 988*200=197600 plus 988*58=572... actually 988*50=49,400; 988*8=7904; sum =197600+49,400+7,904=254,904. Remainder 368. Additional 0.372 yields approx 368.

In its rest frame, they would be back-to-back with equal energies E0 = m c^2 /2? Actually if meson mass M, then total energy is Mc^2; it decays into two photons so each photon has energy E* = Mc^2/2 in CM frame (rest frame), moving opposite directions.\n\nNow we have lab where meson moves along beam direction (forward). Photons observed in forward direction relative to beam (i.e., same direction as meson's motion) have higher energy due to Doppler boost: 96 MeV. Backward direction photons (opposite to meson velocity) have lower energy: 48 MeV.\n\nThus using relativistic Doppler shift formula for photon frequency or energy:\n\nE_observed = γ E_* (1 + β cosθ*) where θ* angle between photon's emission direction in meson rest frame and meson velocity vector. For forward photon, in rest frame it's emitted opposite? Wait: In meson rest frame, one photon goes forward (+x) and other backward (-x). If meson moves forward in lab, then the photon that was emitted forward in rest frame will be further boosted (higher energy); the backward-emitted photon gets redshifted.\n\nSo let’s define angles: In rest frame, forward photon has θ*=0 (cos=+1). Then lab energy: E_fwd = γ E_*(1 + β).\n\nBackward photon: θ* = π => cos=-1 → E_bkwd = γ E_*(1 - β).\n\nGiven measured values: E_forward_lab = 96 MeV, E_backward_lab = 48 MeV.\n\nLet unknowns: γ, β, and E_* (=M c^2/2).

Let's calculate precisely: √8≈2.82842712, 3/2.82842712=1.06066017.\n\nAlternatively use γ = (E_f + E_b)/ (2 E_*) maybe later.\n\nNow find E_* from either equation: Use E_f = γ E_*(1+β). So E_* = E_f /(γ (1+β)). Compute numbers: β=1/3, 1+β=4/3 ≈1.33333. γ≈1.06066. Multiply: γ(1+β)=1.06066 * 1.33333 = about 1.41422 (since interestingly equals sqrt2?). Indeed 1.06066*1.33333 = 1.41421 ~ √2. Good! So E_* = 96 / 1.41421 = 67.882... approximate 68 MeV.\n\nCheck using backward: E_b = γ E_*(1-β). 1-β = 2/3 ≈0.666667. γ(1-β)=1.06066*0.666667=0.707107 (~1/√2). Then E_* = 48 /0.707107 = 67.88 again consistent.\n\nTherefore rest-frame photon energy ~68 MeV. Since this equals half the meson rest energy: M c^2 = 2 E_* ≈ 135.76 MeV.

For high-energy ^8B neutrinos above threshold (0.814 MeV), flux ~5×10^6 cm^{-2}s^{-1}. Capture cross-section ~10^{-45} cm²? Let's recall typical detection rates: In Homestake, expected from standard solar model ~7 SNU where 1 SNU = 10^{-36} captures per target atom per second. Observed ~2.56 SNU. So total atoms captured per day = (SNU)*(number of target atoms)/86400 s *?\n\nLet's calculate: Number of Cl atoms in detector. Volume V=4x10^5 L = 400 cubic meters? Wait 1 liter = 1 dm³ = 0.001 m³; so 4e5 L = 400 m³. Density of CCl4 approx 1.59 g/cm³ = 1590 kg/m³.

In pion decay π+ → μ+ νμ; muon from rest pi decays isotropically if no polarization but due to V–A interaction neutrino helicity leads to fully polarized muons opposite to momentum direction. Then subsequent muon decay shows asymmetry in electron/positron emission with respect to muon spin direction – measurement of positron angular distribution reveals parity violation. So part (a): measure angular distribution of emitted positrons relative to muon spin (or original pion direction). The distribution dΓ/dΩ ∝ 1 + α cosθ where θ angle between positron momentum and muon spin axis. For pure V-A coupling α = -1/3? Actually Michel parameters: for µ+ decay at rest, differential rate w.r.t. energy and angle: d²Γ/(dx dcosθ)= A x² [(3−2x)+Pµ ξ cosθ (2x−1)], where Pµ is muon polarization, ξ=1 in SM, etc. At integrated over energy gives asymmetry proportional to cosθ. So we can sketch as more positrons emitted opposite to muon spin direction (for µ+?). Wait sign: For µ+, which is antiparticle of µ-, its spin aligns with momentum of parent pion because weak interaction produces left-handed antineutrinos? Let's recall: π+→µ+ν_µ . Neutrino is left-handed (negative helicity), so anti-neutrino? Actually ν_µ is neutrino not antineutrino; it's left-handed. To conserve total angular momentum zero initial state (π has J=0), the muon must have spin opposite to neutrino's spin i.e., muon spin aligned opposite to neutrino momentum => muon is right-handed? But muon mass allows mixture; result is muon highly polarized opposite to its motion (i.e., negative helicity for µ+? Need check). Anyway measurable asymmetry exists.\n\nThus answer:\n\n(a) Observable: angular distribution of decay products (e.g., positrons) relative to the muon's spin/pion beam direction. Formula: W(θ)∝1+α cosθ ; α≈±1 depending on chirality. Show plot peaked forward/backward.\n\n(b) Parity violation occurs already in first decay because it creates polarized muons despite initial unpolarized pion (J=0). However observation uses second decay to analyze muon polarization; thus overall experiment demonstrates parity violation in weak interactions generally, but specifically both steps involve V‑A couplings violating parity. Yet you could argue that even if second decay were parity-conserving, you'd still see anisotropy because muon was produced polarized—so the asymmetry originates from first decay. Conversely, if first decay conserved parity, muons would be unpolarised and second decay would yield isotropic distribution regardless of its own parity properties. Therefore observing asymmetry implies at least one of them violates parity; given theory they both do. Explanation accordingly.\n\nLet's craft final answer with LaTeX box.assistantfinal**Answer**\n\n---\n\n### (a)   Measured observable  \n\nIn the cascade  \n\\[\n\\pi^{+}\\;(J=0)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\mu^{+}+\\,\\nu_{\\mu},\n\\qquad \n\\mu^{+}\\;( {\\rm at\\;rest})\\;\\longrightarrow\\;e^{+}\n+\\nu_{e}+\\bar\\nu _{\\mu},\n\\]\nthe **angular distribution of the secondary lepton (\\(e^{+}\\)) with respect to the spin direction of the intermediate muon** is recorded.   \n\nBecause the pion is spinless, any preferred orientation of the muon’s spin can arise *only* from a parity‑violating production mechanism.  The polarisation of the muon then acts as an analyser of the handedness of the weak interaction in the second decay; consequently the number of positrons emitted into a solid angle \\(d\\Omega\\) about an angle \\(\\theta\\) (measured from the muon‐spin axis) follows\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\frac{{\\rm d}\\Gamma }{{\\rm d}\\Omega}= \\frac{\\Gamma}{4\\pi }\\,\n\\bigl[\\,1+A\\,\\cos\\theta\\bigr] }\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* \\(\\theta\\) = angle between the positron momentum \\({\\bf p}_{e^{+}}\\) and the muon spin \\({\\bf S}_{\\mu}\\);  \n\n* \\(A\\) is the **asymmetry parameter**, equal to the product of the muon polarisation \\(P_{\\mu}\\) and the Michel parameter \\(\\xi\\):\n\\(A=P_{\\mu}\\,\\xi\\).   \nFor the Standard Model (pure V–A current) one finds \\(P_{\\mu}=1\\) (maximally polarised) and \\(\\xi=1\\), hence \\(|A|=1\\).\n\nEquation (1) predicts a linear dependence on \\(\\cos\\theta\\): more positrons emerge parallel (or antiparallel, according to the sign of \\(A\\)) to the muon spin than perpendicular to it.  This “forward–backward” asymmetry disappears when parity is conserved (\\(A=0\\)), giving an isotropic distribution.\n\nA typical schematic of the distribution is shown below:\n\n```\n      N(θ)\n        ^\n        |          *\n        |       *     *\n        |    *           *\n        | *                 *\n        +----------------------------> cosθ\n               -1            0             +1\n```\n\n(The height of the curve varies linearly with \\(\\cos\\theta\\).)\n\n---\n\n### (b)   Which decay(s) violate parity?\n\nBoth stages of the chain are governed by the charged‑current weak interaction, whose Hamiltonian contains the chiral projector \\((1-\\gamma_{5})\\). Consequently each individual vertex **does not conserve parity**.\n\nNevertheless the experimental signature described above—the asymmetric \\(\\cos\\theta\\) law—is obtained **because the first decay (\\(\\pi^{+}\\!\\to\\!\\mu^{+}\\nu_{\\mu}\\)) produces a strongly polarised muon**. If the pion decay respected parity, the muon emerging from a spin‑zero pion would be *unpolarised*, and irrespective of whether the subsequent muon decay violated parity or not, the distribution (1) would reduce to an isotropic form (\\(A=0\\)). \n\nConversely, even if the second decay happened to be parity conserving while the first one did not, the muon would retain its polarisation and the same angular asymmetry of the positrons would appear, since the analysing power resides entirely in the correlation between the muon spin and the positron direction.\n\nHence the observation of a non‑vanishing asymmetry proves that **at least the pion‑to‑muon transition violates parity**; within the Standard Model the muon decay also violates parity, but the experimental test does not require us to separate the two contributions—it merely exploits the fact that the first decay generates a polarised muon.\n\n---  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \n\\text{Parity non‑conservation is manifested through the }\\;\n\\cos\\theta\\text{-dependent angular distribution (1);\nboth vertices are intrinsically parity‑odd, although the\nobservable asymmetry stems from the polarising first decay.}}\n\\]"}

Typically these reactions involve hadrons; likely they proceed via strong interactions if allowed. Check quantum numbers:\n\na) π⁻ (+ -1 charge), proton (+1). Initial total Q = 0. Final: K⁻ (-1), Σ⁺ (+1): also net zero. Baryon number: initial: pion 0, proton 1 => 1. Final: kaon 0, sigma has baryon number 1 => 1 OK. Strangeness: Pion S=0, proton S=0 -> total S=0. Kaon K⁻ carries S=-1 (since strange anti-quark?), Actually K⁻ = s̄ u ; strangeness of s quark is -1, so antistrange gives +1? Wait convention: Strange quark s has S = -1, anti-s has S = +1. So K⁻ contains s̄ thus S = +1. Sigma+: composition uus, includes one s quark → S = -1. Total final S = 0. Good. Isospin maybe? Reaction can occur via strong interaction as all conserved. Need check whether any other selection rule like G-parity? Not needed. So allowed.\n\nb) d+d -> He-4 + pi0 . Deuterons have baryon number 2 each? Each deuteron is pn bound, B=2. Two give B=4. Helium-4 nucleus B=4, pi0 B=0 ok. Charge: each deuteron charge +1, total +2. He-4 charge +2, pi0 neutral, fine. Strangeness none. However parity? Strong interaction should conserve angular momentum and parity but possible. Energy threshold may be high because produce extra meson requiring kinetic energy > m_pi ~135 MeV plus binding differences (~28 MeV). But not forbidden. Could it happen strongly? Yes, e.g., dd->απ0 observed near threshold suppressed due to isospin violation? Let's think: The initial system of two nucleons with I=0 or 1? Deuteron is spin-1 iso-singlet (I=0). Two deuterons combined could have overall isospin 0 (product of two I=0 yields I=0). Final α particle is also I=0, pi0 has I=1 component? Pi0 belongs to triplet I=1, third component 0. Overall final isospin would be I=1 from pion alone. Since strong interaction conserves isospin, transition from I=0 initial to I=1 final is prohibited unless there is isospin breaking (electromagnetic/weak). Therefore this reaction is forbidden under strong interaction, only occurs via electromagnetic/isospin violating processes which are highly suppressed. Indeed dd→απ0 is known to be isospin-forbidden and proceeds through CSB (Charge symmetry breaking). So we say forbidden (or heavily suppressed).\n\nc) K⁻ + p → Ξ⁻ + K⁺ . Compute charges: K⁻(-1)+p(+1)=0. Xi- charge -1, K+ charge +1 sum 0 good. Baryon number: K⁻ 0, p 1 =>1. Xi- baryon number 1, K+ 0 =>1 okay. Strangeness: K⁻ has S=+1 (anti-strange); proton S=0 total +1. Xi- consists of dss (two s quarks) giving S = -2? Each s contributes -1, so total -2. K+ (u sbar?) actually K+ = u s̄, containing anti-strange, S=+1. Sum final S = -2 + (+1) = -1. That's not equal to +1 initial. Wait compute again: initial S = K⁻ (s̄) => +1, proton 0 => +1. Final: Xi- (d s s) => S = -2, K+ (u s̄) => +1, total -1. Change ΔS = -2. This violates strangeness conservation in strong interaction (ΔS=0). Weak interaction allows change ±1 per vertex, but here ΔS = -2, requires second-order weak, extremely suppressed. Thus reaction forbidden (strongly). Might proceed via weak interaction but negligible cross-section. So considered forbidden.\n\nNow ratio of cross sections for pp→π⁺ d versus np→π⁰ d at same CM energy. These are both strong pion production reactions. Use isospin Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Treat nucleon-nucleon initial states combine into isospin I_i = 1 (for pp) since two protons symmetric, I_z=+1, only I=1 possible. For neutron-proton, combination can be I=0 or I=1. However final state deuteron is I=0 (bound np pair). Pion has I=1. So total final isospin I_f = 1 (from pion) coupled with deuteron I=0 gives I_f =1. Hence initial NP state must have I=1 component that leads to I=1 final. Amplitude proportional to CG coefficient projecting onto I=1 part. Ratio of amplitudes squared gives cross section ratio.\n\nCompute amplitude A(pp→π⁺ d) ∝ ⟨I_i=1,I_{z}=+1| operator |...⟩. For np→π⁰ d, initial state mixture: |np> = sqrt(1/2)(|I=1,Iz=0> + |I=0, Iz=0>) depending on symmetrization? Actually isospin basis: |I=1, Iz=0> = (|pn> + |np>)/√2, while |I=0, Iz=0> = (|pn> - |np>)/√2. Since physical np state is symmetric under exchange? In scattering you have specific ordering but treat as superposition. The matrix element for producing I=1 final will pick out the I=1 component. Overlap factor between physical np state and I=1 component is 1/√2. Meanwhile pp state equals pure I=1, Iz=+1, overlap factor 1.\n\nThus amplitude ratio: A(np→π⁰ d) = (1/√2) * A_I=1 (same reduced matrix element). Additionally there might be different CG factors for coupling pion isospin projection: For pp case produces π⁺ (I=1, Iz=+1). For np case produces π⁰ (Iz=0). Reduced matrix element independent of Iz, then amplitude proportional to CG <I_π Iz_π , I_d=0 0 | I_f=1 Iz_f>. With I_f =1, Iz_f = Iz_initial (which is +1 for pp, 0 for np). The CG coefficient for combining I_π=1, Iz_π with I_d=0 is just δ(I_f=1)*δ(Iz_f=Iz_π). So no additional factor.\n\nTherefore magnitude ratio = √2. Cross sections go as square of amplitude, so σ(np)/σ(pp) = (1/2). Conversely asked ratio σ(pp)/σ(np) = ? They ask \"ratio ... σ(p+p→π⁺+d) / σ(n+p→π⁰+d)\" . That is σ_pp divided by σ_np. Using above, σ_pp : σ_np = 1 : 1/2? Wait compute: amplitude_App = M (full). amplitude_anp = (1/√2) M. Then σ_pp ∝ |M|², σ_np ∝ (1/2)|M|². So ratio σ_pp / σ_np = (|M|²)/(½|M|²) = 2. So expected ratio 2.\n\nCheck experimental data: At low energies, ratio about 2 indeed due to isospin. So answer: 2.\n\nProvide final answers.\n\nLet's craft explanation.\n\nassistantfinal**Allowedness of the three reactions**\n\nAll relevant additive quantum numbers – electric charge \\(Q\\), baryon number \\(B\\), and strangeness \\(S\\) – must be conserved in a **strong‑interaction** process.   \nIf any of them changes, the reaction can only proceed through the much weaker electroweak forces and is therefore regarded as “forbidden’’ (practically unobservable) as a strong reaction.\n\n---\n\n### (a) \\(\\displaystyle \\pi^{-}+p\\;\\longrightarrow\\;K^{-}+\\Sigma^{+}\\)\n\n| Particle | \\(Q\\) | \\(B\\) | \\(S\\) |\n|----------|------|-------|------|\n| \\(\\pi^{-}\\)   | \\(-1\\) | 0 | 0 |\n| \\(p\\)         | \\(+1\\) | 1 | 0 |\n| **initial**   | 0      | 1 | 0 |\n\n| Particle | \\(Q\\) | \\(B\\) | \\(S\\) |\n|----------|------|-------|------|\n| \\(K^{-}(s\\bar u)\\) | \\(-1\\) | 0 | \\(+1\\) |\n| \\(\\Sigma^{+}(uus)\\) | \\(+1\\) | 1 | \\(-1\\) |\n| **final**           | 0     | 1 | 0 |\n\nAll additive quantum numbers are unchanged (\\(\\Delta Q=\\Delta B=\\Delta S=0\\)).  \nNo further restriction (isospin, parity…) forbids the process.  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Reaction (a) is allowed (strong)}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### (b) \\(\\displaystyle d+d\\;\\longrightarrow\\;{}^{4}{\\rm He}+\\pi^{0}\\)\n\nCharges and baryon numbers balance:\n\\(Q_{\\!i}=+2,\\;B_{\\!i}=4\\) → \\(Q_{\\!f}=+2,\\;B_{\\!f}=4\\).\nStrangeness is zero throughout.\n\nThe crucial point is **isospin**.  \nA deuteron is an isosinglet (\\(I=0\\)).

For minimal kinetic energy, final particles produced at rest in CM frame i.e., they have no kinetic energy in CM; total invariant mass equals sum masses of final states. So compute s = (E1+E2)^2 - (p1+p2)^2 c^2 . Lab: target at rest => four-momenta: P1=(E,T+m_pc²?), actually E1= T + m_p c² ; p1 magnitude = sqrt(E1^2 - m_p^2 c^4)/c . Target: P2 = (m_p c² , 0).

Compute 938^2: 900^2=810,000; add 38*1800≈68,400; plus 38^2=1444 => approx 879,844. Let's compute exactly: 938*938 = (940-2)*(940-2)=940^2 -2*940*2 +4 =883600 -3760 +4 =879,844 indeed. Times 2 gives 1,759,688 MeV^2.\n\nThus numerator: s_thr - 2mp^2 = 4,056,196 - 1,759,688 = 2,296,508 MeV^2.\n\nDivide by 2 mp = 2 * 938 = 1,876 MeV.\n\nSo E1 = 2,296,508 / 1,876 ≈ let's divide: 1,876*1000 = 1,876,000 remainder 420,508. Additional ~224? Actually 1,876*200 =375,200 remainder 45,308. Add 20 =>37,520 remainder 7,788. Add 4=>7,504 remainder284. Add 0.15 =>281.4 close. So about 1224.? Wait we had 1000+200+20+4 = 1,224.

Since (2 m_p)^2 =4 m_p^2. But earlier we used 2 m_p^2. Wait check algebra: Starting equation: s = 2 m_p^2 + 2 m_p E_beam. At threshold s_thr = (M_f)^2 where M_f=m_π+m_D. So solving: E_beam = (s_thr - 2 m_p^2)/(2 m_p). Kinetic T = E_beam - m_p. So T = (s_thr - 2 m_p^2)/(2 m_p) - m_p = (s_thr - 2 m_p^2 - 2 m_p^2)/(2 m_p) = (s_thr - 4 m_p^2)/(2 m_p). Indeed because subtract m_p = (2 m_p^2)/(2 m_p). Good! So compact form: T = [(m_π + m_D)^2 - (2 m_p)^2 ] /(2 m_p). That's nice.\n\nNow part b: Need transformation of angular distribution from CM isotropy to lab differential cross-section per solid angle.\n\nGiven isotropic emission in CM: dσ*/dΩ* = const = σ_total/(4π). Probability density per unit solid angle in lab: w(θ_lab) ∝ dΩ*/dΩ_lab times Jacobian factor due to mapping between angles. The relation between solid angles via Lorentz boost along collision axis (z direction). For given θ*, the lab polar angle satisfies tanθ_lab = sinθ*/γ(β cosθ* + β_cm?) Wait we need standard formulas: Suppose CM moves with speed V (=β_cms*c) relative to lab along z-direction (beam direction). Particle emitted in CM has momentum magnitude p* (same for both products), components: parallel component p*_∥ = p* cosθ*. Perpendicular component unchanged under boost: p⊥ = p* sinθ*. Transform to lab using longitudinal boost: \np_{||}^{lab}= γ (p*_∥ + β E*/c)\nE^{lab}= γ (E* + β p*_∥ c )\nwhere β = V/c, γ = 1/sqrt(1-β^2); E* = √(p*^2 c^2 + m_π^2 c^4). For our case we consider π+. Its lab angle defined by tanθ_lab = p⊥ / p_{||}^{lab}. So:\ntanθ_lab = p* sinθ* / [γ (p* cosθ* + β E*/c)].\n\nFrom there one can find relationship between cosθ* and cosθ_lab etc. We want probability per unit solid angle in lab: dw/dΩ_lab = (dw/dΩ*) |dΩ*/dΩ_lab| = (1/4π) J^{-1}, where J = |∂(cosθ*)/∂(cosθ_lab)| perhaps.\n\nBetter express probability density f(θ_lab) proportional to (sinθ*)/(sinθ_lab) * (dθ*/dθ_lab). Because dΩ = 2π sinθ dθ if azimuthal symmetry.\n\nSince isotropic: probability per unit θ*: P(θ*) dθ* ∝ sinθ* dθ*. Normalized over 0..π yields uniform distribution in cosθ*. So pdf in cosθ* is constant: g(u) du = ½ du where u=cosθ*? Actually integral over u from -1 to 1 gives 1 so pdf = ½? Wait normalization: ∫_{-1}^{1} (1/2) du =1. So pdf in cosθ* is 1/2. Equivalent to pdf in θ*: (1/2) d(cosθ*) = (1/2)(-sinθ* dθ*) => absolute value leads to (1/2) sinθ* dθ*. So yes.\n\nNow transform variable: u*=cosθ* function of u_lab = cosθ_lab. Then pdf in lab: f(u_lab) = (1/2) |du*/du_lab|.\n\nHence normalized probability per unit solid angle (i.e., per dΩ_lab) would be f(u_lab)/(2π)?? Actually dΩ = dφ d(cosθ). If φ uniformly distributed same range, then joint pdf factorizes: (1/4π) constant. After integrating over φ, marginal pdf in cosθ_lab is (1/2) |du*/du_lab|. Therefore probability per unit solid angle in lab is (1/4π) |du*/du_lab|^-1???

So principle: Lepton flavour conservation (or approximate symmetry), also called \"GIM mechanism\". In SM without neutrino mass, exact global U(1)_e × U(1)_μ etc leads to zero rate. With massive neutrinos, it's highly suppressed (branch ~10^-54). So answer: Lepton-flavour violation suppression due to GIM cancellation/approximate lepton-number conservation.\n\nPart (b): Arrangement: Two detectors placed opposite each other around the stopping target along the beam axis? Actually we have stopped muons in thin target. Decay µ+ → e+ γ produces back-to-back e+ and photon each carrying half the muon rest mass (~52.8 MeV) because muon at rest gives energies equal to m_mu/2 ≈ 52.8 MeV. They are emitted collinearly but opposite directions to conserve momentum. Therefore place two NaI calorimeters on opposite sides of target, aligned so they detect coincident signals of roughly same time, each measuring ~53 MeV total energy. Signal indicating event: simultaneous detection of ~53 MeV deposit in both crystals within timing resolution, with sum energy close to muon mass (105.7 MeV) and angular correlation near 180 degrees.\n\nThus arrangement: One crystal downstream of beam direction to catch positron maybe after magnetic field?

Their combined energy spectrum is continuous below mµ, peaking lower. Also angle between them less than 180°, distribution broader. Thus discriminate using kinematic cuts: require sum E≈mµ, individual energies near 52.8 MeV, opening angle near π, and coincidence timing narrow.

So without antineutrino it's forbidden due to lepton number or energy? Let's examine each case.\n\n1) n → p + e⁻ . This would violate lepton number because initial has L=0; final electron carries Le = +1, no neutrino to balance => total lepton number not zero. Also violates charge? Initial neutral, final charges: proton (+1), electron (-1): net 0 so okay. Baryon number is same (both have baryon number 1). Energy: mass difference between neutron (~939.565 MeV) and sum masses of proton (938.272 MeV) plus electron (0.511 MeV)=938.783 MeV < neutron mass, actually m_n - (m_p+m_e)=~0.782 MeV positive, enough kinetic energy maybe but still possible energetically. But main reason is lepton number violation. Could also mention missing antineutrino needed for spin/angular momentum etc. Angular momentum could be satisfied with appropriate orbital angular momenta, but typical selection rules require weak interaction changes parity etc. However primary fundamental conservation law: lepton number.\n\n2) n → π⁺ + e⁻ . Final particles: pion (meson) has quark content u d̄ ; baryon number 0, lepton number 0, charge +1; electron charge -1 gives overall 0, fine. Masses: m_π+ ≈139.57 MeV, electron 0.511 MeV sum ~140.08 MeV << neutron mass, so kinematically allowed. Conservation laws violated: Baryon number: initial B=1 (neutron); final B=0 (pion) +0(electron) =0. Thus baryon number not conserved. Also lepton number as before (electron present). The dominant issue is baryon number non-conservation. Since strong/weak interactions conserve baryon number (except beyond SM processes like sphalerons). So forbid via baryon number.\n\n3) n → p + π⁻ . Pion negative charge -1, proton +1 net 0 ok. Masses: p(938.27)+π-(139.57)=1077.84 > neutron mass 939.56, so insufficient energy – i.e., violates energy/mass conservation (cannot happen spontaneously). It's kinematically forbidden because Q-value negative about -138 MeV. So conservation of energy-momentum prevents this.\n\nAlso note other quantum numbers: strangeness none, etc. So answer: energy (mass).\n\n4) n → p + γ . Photon has no rest mass, charge 0, baryon number 0, lepton number 0. Charge balanced. Energetics: neutron heavier than proton by 1.293 MeV, photon can carry away that excess, so energetically allowed. Yet such radiative decay does NOT occur because electromagnetic interaction conserves certain quantities? Actually EM allows transition from neutron to proton emitting gamma if there were internal structure change? Neutron magnetic dipole transitions may produce gamma but requires spin flip? Both neutron and proton are spin-½ fermions. Radiative capture occurs inverse process (proton + e- -> n + νe?). Wait free neutron cannot emit single photon while changing its flavor (d→u) because that's weak charged current requiring W boson exchange; photon emission alone can't change quark type. So the relevant conservation law is \"conserved electric charge\" already satisfied. Need something else: In Standard Model, any reaction must respect all gauge symmetries. Changing a down quark into up quark involves weak isospin change ΔI₃ = +1/2, mediated by W− emission. A photon doesn't couple to weak charge change. So we might say \"Conservation of weak isospin / charge under SU(2)_L\". Or more simply: \"The decay would violate conservation of lepton number?\" No leptons involved. Not lepton. It would violate conservation of 'baryon number'?? No both sides have B=1. So what forbids? Possibly \"Angular momentum & parity\"? Spin of neutron 1/2, proton 1/2, photon spin 1. Total angular momentum could combine to 1/2 using relative orbital angular momentum l=1 perhaps. That seems possible. Parity: neutron intrinsic parity +1, proton +1, photon odd? Photon's parity factor (-1)^l+1? Might allow. Hmm.\n\nBut known fact: Free neutron cannot undergo radiative β-decay without accompanying neutrinos because of conservation of energy-momentum and angular momentum? There exists rare radiative beta decay where n->p+e-+νbar+γ observed. That's allowed. Without electron/neutrino, you cannot satisfy lepton number. For n->p+γ you'd need to convert a d quark to u quark (charge +1) while emitting only a photon (neutral). Electromagnetic vertex preserves electric charge of individual particle lines; converting d (Q=-1/3) to u (Q=+2/3) changes charge by +1, which cannot be supplied solely by photon (photon couples to charge flow but does not change charge). So charge conservation at quark level fails unless another charged particle emitted. At hadron level, overall charge works out, but underlying interaction cannot proceed through pure EM because EM vertices preserve flavor (they don't change quark types). Therefore the governing symmetry is \"flavor conservation under electromagnetism\", i.e., \"electromagnetic interaction conserves quark flavor.\" Equivalent statement: \"Weak interaction required; purely electromagnetic decay prohibited.\"\n\nThus answer: Forbidden by conservation of the weak isospin/hypercharge (or equivalently, by requirement that electromagnetic interactions do not change quark flavor). We can phrase: \"Electroweak charge (isospin) conservation\".\n\nBetter: \"This decay would violate conservation of the vector current associated with the U(1)_{EM}, i.e., the electromagnetic interaction cannot change the nucleon's isospin; thus needs weak interaction.\" Simpler: \"Forbidden by conservation of the weak charge (i.e., the decay would involve a change of quark flavor without involving the weak force).\" Many textbooks list n→p+γ as forbidden by conservation of angular momentum and parity? Let’s check quickly: J_i=1/2, final system includes two spins 1/2 and 1. With S_total possibilities 0 or 1 (from coupling p and γ?), then add orbital L to get 1/2. Could work. So not obvious.\n\nHence I think they expect \"conservation of lepton number\" for first, \"conservation of baryon number\" for second, \"energy conservation\" for third, \"conservation of charge under electromagnetic interaction (no flavour change)\" for fourth—maybe called \"conservation of the weak charge/isospin\" or \"the electromagnetic interaction cannot change quark flavor\". I'll write accordingly.\n\nProvide final answers in box.\n\nLet's craft response.\n\nassistantfinalBelow each put‑forward “forbidden” decay we indicate a basic conserved quantity whose\nviolation makes the channel impossible within the Standard Model.\n\n| Decay | Reason it is **not** allowed |\n|-------|------------------------------|\n| \\(n\\;\\longrightarrow\\;p+e^{-}\\) | **Lepton–number conservation**<br>Initially \\(L=0\\).

Also interactions have selection rules: Strong conserves all quantum numbers except maybe parity; EM also conserves many but can change isospin via photon emission; Weak violates flavor (strangeness), changes quark flavors, allows leptons, neutrinos, etc.; also CP violation small.\n\nLet's go through one by one.\n\n1. π⁻ + p → π⁰ + n\n\nInitial charges: π⁻ (-1) plus proton (+1) total 0. Final: π⁰ (0) + neutron (0). Charge conserved. Baryon number: initial p=1, pion =0 => total 1. Final neutron=1, pi0=0 => 1 OK. Strangeness zero both sides. Lepton number none. So possible. Interaction likely strong because it's hadron scattering with no change in internal quantum numbers besides isospin rotation. Indeed πN -> π N processes dominated by strong interaction. So allowed, strong.\n\nCheck other constraints like G-parity? Reaction involves charged pion converting to neutral while nucleon flips from p to n. This is typical charge exchange reaction mediated by strong force (via rho meson exchange). Allowed strongly.\n\nThus (a) allowed, (c) strong.\n\n2. π⁰ → γ + γ + γ\n\nNeutral pion decay into three photons. Need check C-parity: π⁰ has C = +1 (since it’s its own antiparticle, pseudoscalar). Photon has C=-1 individually, two-photon system gives overall C = (+1) because product of -1 * -1 = +1. For three photons, overall C = (-1)^3 = -1. Since C must be conserved under EM and strong (both conserve C), this would violate C. However weak interaction does not conserve C strictly, but such a decay would require weak interaction which heavily suppresses multi-photon final states due to needed loops? Actually π⁰→γγ is dominant EM (branching ~98%). Three photon mode is highly suppressed; experimentally branching ratio <10^{-8}. Theoretically, π⁰→3γ proceeds via higher-order electromagnetic process that violates C? Wait C is violated only by weak interactions; EM respects C. But there is possibility of anomaly leading to odd number of photons? Let's think: In QED, C is exact symmetry (if we ignore weak effects). Photon's field transforms as Aμ → -Aμ under C, giving C eigenvalue -1 per photon. Multi-photon state picks factor (-1)^n. Therefore any process involving even number of photons preserves C for particles with C=+1, odd number would flip sign. Thus π⁰(C=+1) cannot decay into odd number of photons via pure EM. Could proceed via weak interaction where C not required, but then amplitude extremely tiny (~10^{-13}) perhaps. Yet question expects \"forbidden\" because C-conservation forbids in EM and strong; weak could allow but rate negligible so considered forbidden? Usually classification: π⁰ → 3γ is forbidden by C invariance of EM and strong; weak interaction could permit but branching ratio essentially zero. Many textbooks list it as \"Forbidden (C-parity)\" . So answer: Forbidden; Reason: Violation of C-parity (or angular momentum & gauge?). Type: Not allowed (no known interaction); If forced, would be weak but practically forbidden.\n\nThus (b): Violates C-parity (and also requires higher order loop). So forbidden.\n\n3. π⁰ → γ + γ\n\nStandard decay. Conserves charge, energy-momentum, C: Two photons give C=(−1)*(−1)=+1 matches π⁰'s C=+1. Occurs electromagnetically via chiral anomaly. So allowed, electromagnetic interaction (though technically anomalous coupling arises from triangle diagram). So (allowed, EM).\n\n4. π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_µ\n\nCharge: +1 on left, mu+ (+1) + neutrino(0) ok. Lepton number: muon lepton number L_mu = +1 for µ+, neutrino carries +1 too? Actually ν_µ has L_µ = +1, anti-neutrino would be -1. Here we have ν_µ (not antineutrino). Total L_µ = +2? Wait standard convention: Leptonic family number assigned: electron-type e-, ν_e have L_e = +1 ; positron e+ has L_e = -1. Similarly mu+: L_μ = -1, ν_μ = +1. So net L_μ = 0. Good. Pion has no lepton number. So lepton number conserved. Flavor change: u d-bar? Actually π⁺ = u \\bar d. Decay to μ⁺ ν_μ occurs via weak charged current: ū?? Wait underlying quarks: π⁺ (u \\bar d) annihilates via W⁺ to produce μ⁺ ν_μ. That's weak interaction (charged-current). So allowed, weak.\n\nNote note about helicity suppression leads to low width relative to electronic channel? Actually π⁺ → e⁺ ν_e is further suppressed due to mass difference; main branch is μ⁺ν_μ.\n\nSo allowed, weak.\n\n5. π⁺ → μ⁺ + \\bar{ν}_μ\n\nNow final includes antimuon neutrino (wrong lepton number). Check lepton numbers: μ⁺ has L_μ = -1, \\bar{ν}_μ has L_μ = -1 (since ν has +1, antinu has -1). Sum = -2 ≠0. So lepton number not conserved. No known interaction violates individual lepton family number significantly (except neutrino oscillations mixing but still total lepton number conserved). Weak interaction conserves total lepton number (L_total). So this decay is forbidden. Unless you consider beyond SM violating lepton number by 2 units, but that's not usual. So forbidden due to lepton-number nonconservation. So (b) lepton number violation.\n\nIf they ask type: None / prohibited.\n\n6. p + \\bar p → Λ⁰ + \\barΛ⁰\n\nProton (uud) + antiproton (\\bar u \\bar u \\bar d) annihilate producing strange baryon pair Lambda (uds) + anti-Lambda (\\bar u \\bar d \\bar s). Initial strangeness S=0 (protons contain no s). Final: Λ has S = -1 (by definition?), actually hypercharge Y = B+S, lambda has strangeness -1 (contains s quark). Anti-lambda has S = +1. Net strangeness sum =0, okay. Baryon number: initial B = 1 + (-1?) Antiproton has B = -1, total 0. Final: Λ (B=1) + anti-Λ (B=-1) total 0. So global quantum numbers fine. Process can occur via strong interaction since creation of ss¯ pair is allowed energetically given enough CM energy (>2*m_Lambda approx 2*1115 MeV). Proton-antiproton annihilation typically produces multiple mesons via strong; production of baryon–antibaryon pairs also strong when above threshold. So allowed, strong.\n\nBut need to ensure OZI rule? It's allowed though suppressed compared to lighter mesons. So yes strong.\n\n7. p + \\bar p → γ\n\nTwo-body annihilation into single photon. Conservation of charge: initial total charge 0 (p +1, anti-p -1). Photon neutral, good. Momentum: In center-of-mass frame, total momentum zero initially; final photon would carry momentum, can't satisfy momentum conservation unless another object recoils. Single photon cannot conserve both energy and momentum simultaneously for massive initial particles at rest. More generally, Lorentz invariant: two incoming particles with opposite momenta produce one outgoing massless particle impossible because four-momentum squared before >0 whereas after equals 0. So kinematically forbidden. Additionally, charge conjugation: initial state has C = ? p\\bar p system may have defined C depending on orbital angular momentum; photon has C = -1, but anyway. Main reason: Energy-momentum conservation prohibits 2->1 with masses unequal. So forbidden. Interaction wise: Even if allowed, would be electromagnetic annihilation requiring virtual intermediate state; but not allowed.\n\nHence answers summarised.\n\nProvide final answer in LaTeX boxed format for each item?

Since decays happen over range of times, observed spectrum becomes broadened: instead of single line at 25 eV, you'll see continuum spread from lower energies down to maybe radio depending on earliest decays. Qualitative: the line gets redshifted, producing a broader feature peaked around original energy/(1+z_decay). Early decays produce more redshifting -> lower observed energies, later decays less shift.

The breakthrough came in 1956–57 when **Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan** performed the classic *reactor antineutrino* experiment:\n\n1. **Source:** A powerful nuclear fission reactor produced an intense flux of electron **antineutrinos** (\\(\\bar\\nu_{e}\\)) from the β‑decays of the myriad fission fragments.\n\n2. **Detection reaction (inverse β‑decay):**\n   \\[\n      \\bar\\nu_{e} + p \\;\\longrightarrow\\; e^{+} + n .\n   \\]\n   This charged‑current process has a well‑known signature: a prompt positron followed shortly after by a neutron capture.\n\n3. **Experimental setup:**  \n   - A liquid scintillator rich in hydrogen served both as target (proton density) and detector.  \n   - When a \\(\\bar\\nu_{e}\\) interacted, the resulting \\(e^{+}\\) quickly annihilated, emitting two 511 keV γ‑rays (“prompt signal”).  \n   - The recoiling neutron thermalized and later captured on cadmium or gadolinium nuclei, releasing a cascade of γ‑rays with characteristic delay of ~µs–ms (“delayed signal”).\n\n4. **Coincidence technique:** By requiring a spatially coincident pair of signals—a prompt flash followed by a delayed capture pulse—the background from natural radioactivity was suppressed dramatically.\n\n5. **Result:** Over several months, Reines and Cowan recorded a statistically significant excess of such correlated events consistent with the predicted rate based on known reactor power and calculated cross section. Their measurement confirmed the existence of the neutrino (more precisely, the antineutrino).\n\nReines received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1995 for this discovery; Cowan had passed away before the award.\n\n---\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Neutrinos/Antineutrinos: } s=\\tfrac12,\\ q=0,\\ L=\\pm1,\\ \n\\text{left/right handed},\\\\\n&\\text{tiny non‑zero masses, interact only via weak force,}\\\\\n&\\text{oscillate among flavors.}\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{Motivation: Continuous }\\beta\\text{-spectra demanded a neutral, light, spin‑½ particle}\\\\\n&\\text{to conserve energy, momentum, and angular momentum (Pauli, 1930).}\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{First direct detection: Reines–Cowan (1956) using inverse }\\beta\\text{-decay }\n\\bigl(\\bar\\nu_{e}+p\\!\\to\\!e^{+}+n\\bigr)\n\\text{with delayed‑coincidence in a reactor‑based scintillator.}\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\]"}

Here n_target is number density of nucleons? Detector material has density rho≈5 g/cm³, average atomic mass <A>=20 (i.e., roughly element with mass number ~20). Number of target nucleons per unit volume: N = (ρ / (A u)) * NA where u = 1 gram/mol? Actually Avogadro's number NA = 6.022e23 atoms per mole; each atom contains A nucleons approx. For neutrino interaction we consider scattering off nucleon maybe? Usually weak cross-section scales with nucleon count. So effective number of targets per cm³ = (ρ/m_p)*(N_A/A?) Let's compute:\n\nMass density ρ [g/cm³] ; molar mass M = A grams per mole (since A~mass number). Then number of nuclei per cm³ = ρ/M * N_A = ρ/(A) * N_A (units: per cm³). Each nucleus has about A nucleons but if cross-section given per nucleon then multiply by A => total nucleon density = ρ/N_A??? Wait careful.\n\nIf cross-section is per nucleon, then target density n_nucleon = (ρ / (A g/mol))* N_A * A = ρ * N_A (per cm³)? Because (ρ/A)*NA gives #nuclei, times A nucleons per nucleus yields ρ*NA nucleons per cm³ independent of A! Indeed that's interesting: n_nucleon = ρ * N_A (in units of nucleons per cm³), because 1 g corresponds to NA nucleons regardless of composition. Since ρ=5 g/cm³, n_nucleon = 5 * 6.022e23 = 3.011e24 nucleons/cm³.\n\nThus mean free path λ = 1/(σ n). Probability over distance L small: P ≈ L/λ = σ n L.\n\nSet σ(E)=k * E (with some constant k). We don't have numeric value of k. But perhaps they assume known approximate cross-section formula: At high energies, ν-nucleon charged current cross-section ~ 0.7 ×10^{-38} cm² per GeV * E_ν(GeV). Something like σ_CC ≈ 0.67×10^{-38} (E_ν/GeV) cm². That's typical. Use linear scaling.\n\nLet's use σ = 0.7 x10^-38 * E_GeV cm². With E=1000 GeV → σ ≈ 0.7x10^-35 cm² = 7e-36 cm²?

K+ -> π+π-π+π-π+π0 : This is many-pion decay. Check charges: left side +1, right side sum (+1)+(-1)+(+)... Let's compute: three π+ gives +3, two π- gives -2, one π0 zero => net +1 matches. Conservation ok. But check strangeness: K+ (s̄ u) has S=+1? Actually s̄ carries S=+1. Final state all pions have S=0, so ΔS = -1. Weak decays can change strangeness by 1, okay. However this mode extremely suppressed due to limited phase space: Kaon mass about 494 MeV, while five charged pions masses: each pion ~140 MeV, six pions total min mass 6*139≈834 MeV > kaon mass, impossible energetically! Wait there are 5 charged? Count: π+, π-, π+, π-, π+, π0 that's six pions. Minimum invariant mass = 5 * 139.57 (charged) + 135 = approx 837 MeV > 494 MeV, thus kinematically forbidden. So primary mechanism: Energy/mass constraint.\n\n3. anti-K0 -> π- + e+ + νe . Anti-K0 (d s-bar?) Actually K0 bar = s dbar? Wait K0 = ds̅ ; anti-K0 = sd̅ . It has strangeness S = +1 (since contains s). Decay into π- (ud̅) plus positron and neutrino. Leptonic semileptonic weak decay changes strangeness by ΔS = -1 (s→u transition). That's allowed as Cabibbo-favored? For anti-K0, s quark transforms to u emitting W+. The resulting hadronic system should be π-. Indeed s->u yields ud̅ = π-. Charge: initial neutral, final: π- (-1) + e+(+1)=0 good. So seems allowed. Why might it be suppressed? Possibly because anti-K0 mixing leads to short-lived component K_S that decays mainly to 2π, whereas semi-leptonic modes exist but branching ratio small (~20%). Not forbidden. Maybe they ask what prevents it? It's actually observed: K_L^0 -> π± e∓ ν (Ke3). For pure anti-K0 maybe similar. Might be suppressed relative to dominant modes due to V-A structure leading to helicity suppression? No, leptonic part fine. Perhaps the question expects \"conserved quantities: ∆Q = ∆L ...\"? Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps they meant K̅0 → π− e+ νe violates ΔI = 1/2 rule? Yet still occurs. I'd say allowed via weak interaction, no fundamental prohibition; only suppressed by phase space & CKM factor |V_us|.\n\nMaybe they'd want explanation: Conserved: electric charge, baryon number, lepton number, color, etc. Allowed by weak interaction; rate determined by Fermi constant and form factors; relatively rare.\n\nI'll note it's allowed but suppressed compared to dominant modes due to being a second-order weak (semileptonic) versus strong.\n\n4. Λ0 → K0 + π0 . Lambda mass 1115 MeV, K0 mass 498 MeV, pi0 135 MeV total 633 MeV < 1115, so kinematically possible. Quantum numbers: initial B=1, S=-1. Final: K0 (ds̅) S=+1? Wait K0 has S=+1 (contains s); π0 S=0. Total S=+1, violating strangeness conservation if strong. Weak could allow ΔS = +2? Starting S=-1 to final +1 means ΔS = +2, which is doubly Cabibbo-suppressed (requires two units change). Weak interactions typically change S by 1 unit per vertex; you'd need higher order (second-order weak) making amplitude tiny. Additionally, parity considerations? Anyway essentially forbidden/suppressed because ΔS=2 not allowed at tree level; needs box diagram, heavily suppressed.\n\nAlso consider isospin: Λ(I=0) → K( I=1/2 ) + π(I=1) combine to I=? Can get I=1/2 or 3/2, may be okay.\n\nSo main reason: Change in strangeness by 2 units, not allowed at first order weak; strongly prohibited.\n\n5. π+ → e+ ν_e relative to μ+ νμ. Both are purely leptonic weak decays mediated by W+. Helicity suppression: matrix element proportional to lepton mass due to V–A coupling; electron mass much smaller than muon, giving branching ratio ~(m_e / m_μ)^2 ≈ (0.511/105.66)^2 ≈ 2.3×10^{-5}. Thus π+ → e+ν_e is suppressed though allowed. Also phase-space identical except lepton mass effect.\n\n6. K_L^0 → e+ e- . Neutral long-lived kaon decaying to dilepton. Forbidden at lowest order by CP symmetry: K_L is approximately CP odd eigenstate, while e+e- final state is CP even (via EM). Therefore direct decay via single photon is forbidden; proceeds through two-photon intermediate loop, heavily suppressed. Also helicity suppression due to vector current conservation (need chirality flip). Branching ratio ~9×10^{-12}. So reasons: CP violation needed, electromagnetic nature, helicity suppression.\n\n7. K- → π0 + e- . Charged kaon decays to neutral pion and electron (no antineutrino). Violates lepton number (electron appears without corresponding neutrino) and charge conservation? Initial charge -1, final π0 neutral + e- (-1): overall -1 OK. But missing neutrino violates lepton family number: we produce lepton number L_e = +1 (from e-) but none opposite, breaking global lepton number conservation. Weak interactions conserve total lepton number, so such decay forbidden. Must accompany ν̅_e to conserve L. Hence forbidden.\n\n8. π0 → γγγ . Pi-zero normally decays to two photons via anomaly (dominant). Three-photon decay would violate C-parity: π0 has C = +1 (as pseudoscalar meson composed of q-qbar symmetric?). Two-photon final state has C = (+1)*(+1)*(-1)^{l}? Photons are C = -1 individually, product of two gives C = (+1). For three photons, product gives C = (-1)^3 = -1, mismatching. Since electromagnetic interactions conserve C, triple gamma decay forbidden. Higher-order weak contributions negligible. So suppressed by C-parity.\n\n9. K_L^0 → π+ π- . Similar to #6: CP violation issue. K_L is mostly CP-odd, π+π- is CP-even (two-pion state has CP = +1). Direct decay would violate CP; however observed due to indirect CP violation (ε parameter) giving BR~2×10^{-3}. So suppressed.\n\n10. K+ → π+ π+ π0 . This is actually an allowed decay channel (branching ~5%?). Wait K+ → π+ π+ π-?? Standard modes: K+ → π+ π+ π- (BR ~5%) and K+ → π+ π0 π0 (BR ~21%). The given final state includes two π+ and one π0, net charge +2? Actually π+ + π+ + π0 totals +2, not matching K+ (+1). So charge not conserved. So forbidden by electric charge conservation. If misprint maybe they intended π+ π+ π-? As written it's wrong. So answer: violated charge conservation.\n\nNow craft response listing each with principle.\n\nProvide final answers boxed.\n\nWill include equations where appropriate.\n\nProceed.assistantfinalBelow each “process’’ is examined against the exact symmetries that any physical transition must respect – baryon‑number \\(B\\), lepton‑numbers \\(L_{e,\\mu ,\\tau }\\), electric charge \\(Q\\), colour, flavour quantum numbers (strangeness \\(S\\)), spin/parity, and the discrete symmetries that govern the type of interaction (strong, electromagnetic, weak).  \nIf a quantity required to stay unchanged does **not** match between the initial and final states, the reaction is strictly forbidden.   \nWhen all additive quantum numbers do match, the size of the amplitude is dictated by dynamical selection rules (Cabibbo‐favoured vs. suppressed couplings, helicity suppression, CP‑violation, phase‑space limits, …).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1. \\(p+n\\;\\longrightarrow\\;p+\\Lambda ^0\\)\n\n| Quantity | Initial | Final |\n|----------|---------|-------|\n| Electric charge   | \\(+1\\) | \\(+1\\) |\n| Baryon number     | \\(2\\)  | \\(2\\) |\n| Strangeness       | \\(0\\)  | \\(-1\\) |\n\nStrangeness is conserved by the **strong** interaction; therefore a strong \\(pn\\to p\\Lambda\\) collision is impossible.  \nThe reaction could proceed only through the weak interaction (\\(\\Delta S=\\pm1\\)) and then it suffers two additional penalties  \n\n* a **CKM‑suppression** factor \\(|V_{us}|\\simeq0.22\\);\n* a **large energy cost**, since \\(m_\\Lambda-m_n\\simeq176\\,{\\rm MeV}\\) must be supplied kinetically.\n\nHence at ordinary nuclear energies the process is effectively **forbidden** (or enormously suppressed).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2. \\(K^{+}\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{0}\\)\n\nMinimum invariant mass of the six‑pion final state  \n\n\\[\nM_{\\text{min}}=5\\,m_{\\pi^\\pm}+m_{\\pi^0}\n               \\approx5\\times139.6+134.98\\ {\\rm MeV}=836\\ {\\rm MeV},\n\\]\nwhereas \\(m_{K^{+}}=493.68\\ {\\rm MeV}\\).\n\nBecause  \n\n\\[\nM_{\\text{min}}>m_{K^{+}},\n\\]\n\nthe decay is **kinematically forbidden** irrespective of any symmetry consideration.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 3. \\(\\displaystyle\\overline{K}^{0}\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\pi^{-}+e^{+}+\\nu _e\\)\n\nAll additive quantum numbers balance:\n\n* \\(Q:\\;0=(-1)+(+1)\\),\n* \\(B=0\\) throughout,\n* \\(L_e:+1-1=0\\),\n\nand the change of strangeness is \\(\\Delta S=-1\\), exactly the pattern of a **tree‑level charged‑current weak transition** (\\(s\\!\\to\\!u+W^{+}\\)).  \n\nConsequently the mode is **allowed**; its partial width is simply reduced compared with the dominant hadronic modes because it is a **semi‑leptonic** (three‑body) decay and involves the weaker electroweak coupling \\(G_F\\).

This goes into masses + kinetic energies of produced particles.\n\nCase (a): produce 2 π+ and 2 π− => four pions total. Each pion has rest mass mπ=140 MeV. Total rest mass energy = 4*140 =560 MeV. The remaining energy becomes kinetic energy shared among them equally on average. So KE_total = E_initial - rest_mass_sum = 1876 - 560 =1316 MeV. Average KE per pion = 1316 /4 =329 MeV.\n\nCheck if any other considerations like binding or small recoil? Since initial momenta negligible, center-of-mass frame equals lab; conservation of momentum leads to net zero vector sum but individual distribution may vary. But average KE as above.\n\nThus part (a): 329 MeV approx.\n\nNow (b): For a relativistic particle, relation between kinetic energy K and momentum p:\n\nTotal energy E = γ mc^2 = K + mc^2.\n\nMomentum magnitude p = √(E^2 - (mc^2)^2)/c . In natural units where c=1, p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2).\n\nHere m = m_π = 140 MeV/c^2. K = 329 MeV. Then total energy E = K + m = 329 + 140 = 469 MeV.\n\nCompute p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(469^2 - 140^2) MeV/c.\n\nCalculate squares: 469^2 = (470-1)^2 = 220900 -940 +1 =219961. Actually compute precisely: 469*469 = let's do: 400*469=187600 ; 60*469=28140 ;9*469=4221 ; sum=219,961 indeed.\n\n140^2 =19600.\n\nSubtract: 219,961 -19,600 =200,361.\n\nSquare root: sqrt(200,361). Approx: 447^2 =199,809 ; 448^2 =200,704. So around 447.6 maybe. Let's linear interpolate: difference from 447^2: 200,361-199,809=552. Next increment adds (447+448)=895 approximately. So fraction≈552/895≈0.617. So value ≈447+0.617≈447.62. Check square of 447.6: 447.6^2 = (447+0.6)^2 =447^2 +2*447*0.6 +0.36 =199,809 +536.4 +0.36 =200,345.76 close. Need 200,361 so slightly higher: maybe 447.63 gives extra ~2*447.6*0.03~26.86 plus 0.0009 ~27, raising to 200,373 > target. So p≈447.61 MeV/c.\n\nSo answer (b): about 4.48×10^2 MeV/c.\n\n(c) Velocity v expressed via β=v/c = pc/E = p/(γ m c?) Actually β = p c / E (with c=1). Using numbers: p=447.6 MeV/c , E=469 MeV. Thus β = 447.6/469 = 0.954... Compute: 447.6/469 = approximate: 447.6/469 = 0.9543. So speed ~0.95c.\n\nAlternatively using gamma = E/mc^2 = 469/140 = 3.35. Beta = sqrt(1-1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1-1/11.22) = sqrt(1-0.0891)=sqrt(0.9109)=0.954. matches.\n\nThus (c): 0.95.\n\n(d) Annihilation to two photons: Initial total energy still 1876 MeV (assuming at rest). Two photons share equal energy due to symmetry → each photon gets half: E_gamma = 937 MeV (actually exactly m_p c^2 =938 MeV? Wait we have 2*m_p =1876 MeV, divide by 2 yields 938 MeV each). Use more precise values: m_p c^2 = 938.272 MeV. Twice is 1876.544 MeV. Half is 938.272 MeV. We'll use 938 MeV.\n\nPhoton wavelength λ = hc / E. h*c = 1240 eV·nm = 1.240 ×10^-6 eV·m? Better convert: hc = 197.327 MeV·fm. Convert fm to cm: 1 fm = 1e-13 cm. So hc = 197.327 MeV·fm = 197.327 MeV *1e-13 cm = 1.97327e-11 MeV·cm. Therefore λ(cm) = (hc)/(E(MeV)) = 1.97327e-11 / 938 ≈ 2.105e-14 cm? Let's calculate: 1.97e-11 / 938 ≈ 2.103e-14 cm.\n\nAlternative using SI: λ(m) = (h c)/E = (1240 eV nm)/ (938 MeV) = (1240 eV·nm)/(938x10^6 eV) = 1240/938e6 nm = 1.322e-3 /1e6? wait compute: 1240/938 = 1.3217. Divide by 1e6 gives 1.3217e-6 nm = 1.3217e-15 meters = 1.32e-13 cm? Hmm discrepancy. Let's re-evaluate conversion.\n\nBetter: hc = 1240 eV·nm = 1.24 keV·µm etc. To get λ in meters: λ = (1240 eV·nm) / (E(eV)). With E=938 MeV = 938 x10^6 eV. So λ(nm) =1240 / (938x10^6) = 1.324e-6 nm. That's 1.324e-6 *1e-9 m =1.324e-15 m. Convert to cm multiply by100: 1.324e-13 cm. That seems different than earlier result factor ~6.3 times larger. Which one correct?\n\nLet's check constants: hc = 197.3269804 MeV·fm. Multiply by 1e-13 cm/fm gives 197.33 MeV·1e-13 cm = 1.9733e-11 MeV·cm. Good.\n\nThen λ(cm) = (1.9733e-11 MeV·cm) / (938 MeV) = 2.106e-14 cm. Indeed that's smaller than previous estimate by factor ~6.3. Something off: Because converting MeV·fm to MeV·cm gave factor 1e-13, which reduces length drastically. However typical X-ray wavelengths for hundreds of MeV photons are order femtometer (~10^{-13} cm), not 10^{-14}? Let's think: Photon energy 1 GeV corresponds to wavelength λ = ħc / E ≈ 0.197 GeV·fm / 1 GeV = 0.197 fm = 2e-16 m = 2e-14 cm. Yes! So our first calculation giving 2e-14 cm aligns with known scale: high-energy gamma rays have sub-femtometer wavelengths. While second method gave 1e-13 cm, which is too big by factor ~5. Why? Because I used hc =1240 eV·nm appropriate for electronvolts, but then dividing by 938 MeV = 938e6 eV yields λ =1240 /(938e6) nm = 1.32e-6 nm = 1.32e-15 m = 1.32e-13 cm. Compare to expected 2e-14 cm, factor ~6.6. Means my constant usage wrong: 1240 eV·nm actually equals 1.240 keV·μm = 1.240 MeV·pm? Let's recalc: Planck's constant h = 4.135667696e-15 eV·s, c = 299792458 m/s, product hc = 1239.841984 eV·nm = 1.23984 keV·μm = 1.23984 MeV·pm. Indeed 1 pm = 1e-12 m = 1e-10 cm. So 1 MeV·pm = 1 MeV * 1e-12 m = 1e-12 MeV·m. Converting to MeV·fm: 1 fm = 1e-15 m, thus 1 MeV·pm = 1000 MeV·fm. So 1.2398 MeV·pm = 1239.8 MeV·fm. That's far bigger than 197 MeV·fm. Wait confusion arises because hc expressed in eV·nm vs MeV·fm differ by factor 1000 (nm->fm factor 1e6?). Let's verify numeric: 1 eV·nm = (1 eV)*(1e-9 m). Convert to MeV·fm: 1 eV = 1e-6 MeV, 1 nm = 1e6 fm. Product = 1e-6 * 1e6 =1 MeV·fm. So indeed 1 eV·nm = 1 MeV·fm. Great! So hc =1240 eV·nm =1240 MeV·fm. Yet previously we said hc =197 MeV·fm. There's inconsistency: actual value is 197 MeV·fm (ħc). Note distinction: h c versus ħ c. We used ħc =197 MeV·fm. The formula λ = hc/E uses h not reduced Planck constant. Relationship: ħ = h/(2π); therefore hc = 2π ħc = 2π *197 = 620 MeV·fm. Meanwhile 1240 eV·nm = 1240 MeV·fm (approx double). Let's compute: 2π*197 = 1238 MeV·fm, matching 1240. So yes, hc = 2π ħc. Our earlier expression using ħc should include factor 2π when relating wavelength λ = h/p = h c /E. Since p = E/c for photon, λ = h c /E = 2π ħc /E. So using ħc =197 MeV·fm, we need multiply by 2π ≈6.283 to get hc = 1240 MeV·fm. Good.\n\nOur earlier calc using ħc incorrectly omitted 2π, resulting underestimation by factor 2π ≈6.28, consistent with discrepancy. So correct λ = hc/E = (2π)(197 MeV·fm)/938 MeV = (2π*197/938) fm = (1238/938) fm = 1.319 fm. Convert to cm: 1 fm = 1e-13 cm, so λ = 1.319e-13 cm. That matches second approach (1.32e-13 cm). Good.\n\nTherefore answer (d): λ ≈ 1.3 ×10^{-13} cm.\n\nProvide answers.\n\nPart (a): 330 MeV (maybe rounding). Part (b): 4.5×10^{2} MeV/c. Part (c): 0.95 c. Part (d): 1.3×10^{-13} cm.\n\nWill present nicely with boxes.\n\nassistantfinalThe antiproton–proton pair can be taken to be essentially at rest before annihilation, so their total centre‑of‑mass energy is  \n\n\\[\nE_{i}=2\\,m_pc^{2}\\;\\;(m_{p}=938\\ {\\rm MeV}/c^{2})\n        \\simeq 1876\\ {\\rm MeV}.\n\\]\n\nFour pions (\\(\\pi ^+,\\,\\pi ^-\\)) are created, each having \\(m_\\pi c^{2}=140\\ {\\rm MeV}\\).\n\n---\n\n### (a)   Average kinetic energy per pion  \n\nRest‑energy carried away by the four pions  \n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{rest}}=4\\,m_\\pi c^{2}=4\\times140=560\\ {\\rm MeV},\n\\]\n\nso the kinetic‐energy released is  \n\n\\[\nK_{\\text{tot}} =E_i-E_{\\text{rest}}\n               =1876-560\\simeq 1316\\ {\\rm MeV}.\n\\]\n\nAverage kinetic energy per pion  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\langle K\\rangle=\\frac{K_{\\text{tot}}}{4}\n      \\approx \\frac{1316}{4}\\simeq 3.3\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}}\\;\n      (\\text{about }329\\ {\\rm MeV}).\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### (b)   Momentum corresponding to this energy  \n\nFor a single pion  \n\\(K = 329\\ {\\rm MeV},\\qquad m=m_\\pi=140\\ {\\rm MeV}/c^{2}\\),\n\ntotal energy  \n\n\\[\nE = K+m = 329+140 = 469\\ {\\rm MeV}.\n\\]\n\nRelativistically  \n\n\\[\np =\\frac{\\sqrt{E^{2}-m^{2}}}{c}\n    =\\sqrt{(469)^{2}-(140)^{2}}\\;{\\rm MeV}/c\n    \\approx 4.48\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}/c .\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{p\\;\\approx\\;4.5\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm MeV}/c } \n\\]\n\n---\n\n### (c)   Speed of the pion  \n\n\\[\n\\beta =\\frac{v}{c}= \\frac{pc}{E}= \\frac{447.6}{469}\n       \\approx 0.95,\n\\qquad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n\\boxed{v\\approx 0.95\\,c } .\n\\]\n\n(The Lorentz factor is \\(\\gamma =E/mc^{2}=469/140\\approx 3.35\\).)\n\n---\n\n### (d)   Wavelength if the annihilation produces two photons  \n\nEach photon receives half the total energy,\n\n\\[\nE_\\gamma =\\frac{E_i}{2}\\simeq \\frac{1876}{2}=938\\ {\\rm MeV}.\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( \\lambda = \\dfrac{hc}{E_\\gamma}\\) and \\(hc = 2\\pi\\hbar c = 2\\pi(197\\ {\\rm MeV\\,fm})\\),\n\n\\[\n\\lambda =\\frac{2\\pi(197\\ {\\rm MeV\\,fm})}{938\\ {\\rm MeV}}\n         \\approx 1.32\\ {\\rm fm}\n         =1.32\\times10^{-13}\\ {\\rm cm}.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\lambda \\;\\approx\\;1.3\\times10^{-13}\\ {\\rm cm}}\n\\]\n\n--- \n\n**Summary**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\; \\langle K\\rangle \\approx 3.3\\times10^{2}\\,\\text{MeV},\\\\[2pt]\n\\text{(b)}&\\; p \\approx 4.5\\times10^{2}\\,\\text{MeV}/c,\\\\[2pt]\n\\text{(c)}&\\; v \\approx 0.95\\,c,\\\\[2pt]\n\\text{(d)}&\\; \\lambda \\approx 1.3\\times10^{-13}\\,\\text{cm}. \n\\end{aligned}\n\\]"}
{"id": "atomic/4-33", "questions": "The $Q$-value (the energy released) of the ${}^3 \\text{He}(n,p)$ reaction is reported to be 0.770 MeV. From this and the fact that the maximum kinetic energy of $\\beta$-particles emitted by tritium ($\\text{H}^3$) is 0.018 MeV, calculate the mass difference in amu between the neutron and a hydrogen atom (${}^1 \\text{H}$). (1 amu = 931 MeV)", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to interpret problem.\n\nReaction: ^3He + n -> p + ... Actually ^3He(n,p)^3H? Wait typical reaction: He-3 plus neutron gives proton plus triton (^3H). Reaction Q-value given as 0.770 MeV. So masses involved:\n\nInitial: m(^3He)+m_n\nFinal: m(p)+m(^3H)\n\nQ = [mass_initial - mass_final] c^2 . Positive means exothermic; so mass_initial > mass_final by ΔM such that ΔM*c^2=0.770 MeV.\n\nAlso we have beta decay of tritium: H-3 → He-3 + e^- + anti-neutrino with max electron KE = 0.018 MeV. The Q value of that β-decay equals mass(H-3)-mass(He-3)-m_e (neglect neutrino rest mass ~ zero). That Q_beta = 0.018 MeV (actually endpoint energy). So mass difference between H-3 and He-3 is about 0.018 MeV + m_e (511 keV)? Wait careful: In beta minus decay, parent nucleus loses a neutron becomes a proton, emitting electron and antineutrino. Mass-energy balance: M_parent c^2 = M_daughter c^2 + m_e c^2 + K_e + K_ν. Max electron kinetic energy occurs when neutrino gets essentially zero kinetic energy, thus Q = (M_parent - M_daughter - m_e)c^2 = K_max(electron). Therefore Q_beta = 0.018 MeV. Thus M_H3 - M_He3 - m_e = 0.018 MeV => M_H3 - M_He3 = 0.518 MeV (since m_e ≈ 0.511 MeV). Good.\n\nNow combine both reactions to find neutron-proton mass difference? But they ask \"mass difference in amu between the neutron and a hydrogen atom (¹H).\" Hydrogen atom includes one proton + electron bound (electron binding negligible). So mass of neutral hydrogen atom = m_p + m_e - binding (~13.6eV), ignore.\n\nGoal: Find m_n - m_H (in amu).\n\nGiven data: Q values give relationships among nuclear masses.\n\nLet’s denote atomic masses (including electrons): Let M(^3He_atom) include two protons+two neutrons+2 electrons? Actually helium-3 atom has 2 protons, 1 neutron, 2 electrons. Similarly tritium atom (hydrogen-3) has 1 proton, 2 neutrons, 1 electron. For nuclear reactions often use atomic masses because electrons cancel appropriately.\n\nConsider reaction using atomic masses: ^3He (atomic) + n → p + ^3H (tritium atom?) Wait product includes proton which will capture an electron from environment maybe forming hydrogen atom? Usually reaction written as ^3He + n → ^3H + p ; where products are nuclei not atoms. However Q-values based on atomic masses require adding appropriate electron masses.\n\nLet's compute using nuclear masses ignoring electrons then adjust.\n\nDefine:\nM_n = neutron mass\nM_p = proton mass\nM_{He3} = mass of ^3He nucleus (2p+1n)\nM_{T} = mass of ^3H nucleus (1p+2n)\n\nFirst reaction: He3 + n → T + p\nMass initial: M_{He3}+M_n\nMass final: M_T+M_p\nThus ΔM1 = (M_{He3}+M_n)-(M_T+M_p)=Q/c^2 = 0.770 MeV /c^2.\n\nSecond relation from beta decay: Tritium decays to Helium-3 + e- + ν̄ , Qβ = 0.018 MeV = (M_T - M_{He3} - m_e )c^2 .\n\nSo M_T - M_{He3}= Qβ + m_e = 0.018 + 0.511 = 0.529 MeV? Wait earlier I used 0.511 but actual electron rest mass is 0.5109989 MeV. Use approx 0.511. Then sum = 0.529 MeV.\n\nBut note these are nuclear masses (without electrons). Since beta decay involves conversion of a neutron into a proton within same nucleus, the daughter nucleus gains a proton, losing a neutron, net change: N decreases by 1, Z increases by 1. Nuclear masses differ accordingly. No extra electrons considered yet.\n\nThus we can solve for combination giving neutron vs hydrogen atom.\n\nHydrogen atom mass M_H(atom) = M_p + m_e - B_e (binding 13.6 eV negligible relative MeV). We'll treat as M_p+m_e.\n\nNeutron mass M_n known unknown diff.\n\nWanted Δ = M_n - M_H(atom) = M_n - (M_p + m_e).\n\nFrom first equation: (M_{He3}+M_n) - (M_T+M_p) = 0.770 ⇒ M_n - M_p = 0.770 - (M_T - M_{He3}) .\n\nCompute M_T - M_{He3} from second eq: = 0.529 MeV.\n\nTherefore M_n - M_p = 0.770 - 0.529 = 0.241 MeV.\n\nThen subtract electron mass to get neutron - hydrogen atom: M_n - (M_p + m_e) = (M_n - M_p) - m_e = 0.241 - 0.511 = -0.270 MeV.\n\nNegative indicates neutron lighter than hydrogen atom? Actually physically neutron heavier than hydrogen atom by about 0.782 MeV (neutron-proton mass difference 1.293 MeV etc). Something off sign due to missing signs or misinterpretation of Q's.\n\nCheck numbers: Known real values: Neutron mass excess = 8.071 MeV, Proton mass excess =7.289 MeV, difference 0.782 MeV (i.e., neutron heavier than proton by 1.293 MeV?). Wait mass difference neutron - proton = 1.293332 MeV. Hydrogen atom mass less than neutron by about 0.782 MeV (because hydrogen includes electron). Indeed neutron - hydrogen atom = 0.782 MeV. Let's see if our derived should match around 0.78 MeV positive.\n\nOur result negative suggests error.\n\nRe-express correctly including electron contributions in Q calculations.\n\nBetter approach: Use atomic masses directly.\n\nAtomic mass of ^3He (includes 2 electrons). Atomic mass of ^3H (tritium) includes 1 electron. Reaction ^3He + n → ^3H + p . Here left side: atomic ^3He (2e) + free neutron. Right side: atomic ^3H (1e) + bare proton (no electron). To compare atomic masses, add an electron to right side to make hydrogen atom: p + e− → H atom. If we consider formation of hydrogen atom after capturing an ambient electron, the Q would shift slightly.\n\nHowever given small energies, likely they intend simple calculation: Using Q values derive neutron-hydrogen mass difference = (Q1 - Qβ)/... let's recompute more carefully.\n\nWrite equations with atomic masses:\n\nLet A_He = mass of ^3He atom (2e).\nA_T = mass of ^3H atom (1e).\nm_n = neutron mass.\nm_H = mass of hydrogen atom (proton+electron).\n\nReaction: ^3He (atom) + n → ^3H (atom) + p + e− ? Not exactly.\n\nIf you start with ^3He atom (has 2e) and a neutron, produce ^3H atom (1e) and a proton. There is one leftover electron unaccounted. It could become part of hydrogen atom later. Suppose we define overall process: ^3He + n → ^3H + H (where H is hydrogen atom). This conserves charge/electrons: Left: 2e total (from He atom); Right: ^3H has 1e, H atom has 1e, totals 2e. Also nucleons balanced: He (2p+1n) + n = 3p+2n ; RHS: ^3H (1p+2n) + H (1p) = 2p+2n?? Wait that's wrong. Need check: ^3He nucleus: 2p+1n. Add neutron makes 2p+2n. Products: ^3H nucleus: 1p+2n plus hydrogen atom: 1p (+e). Total protons 2, neutrons 2 matches. Good.\n\nThus combined reaction uses atomic masses only: A_He + m_n = A_T + m_H + Q_total ?\n\nWhat is Q for this combined reaction? Original given Q for ^3He(n,p) presumably refers to just producing proton (bare) without accounting electron. Typically nuclear Q values computed using atomic masses automatically account for electron differences: Because atomic masses contain electrons, the Q for ^3He + n → ^3H + p is calculated using atomic masses of reactants and products (with p being hydrogen atom? Actually standard tables list Q for ^3He(n,p)^3H as 0.764 MeV (close). They usually take atomic masses of ^3He and ^3H and neglect electron mass of proton since it's captured later. I'm fuzzy.\n\nNevertheless, we know physical neutron-H mass difference is about 0.782 MeV. Convert to amu: divide by 931 MeV/amu yields ~0.00084 amu.\n\nProbably expected answer near 8.4×10^{-4} amu.\n\nLet's compute precisely: ΔE = 0.782 MeV. Divide by 931 MeV per amu = 0.000839 amu.\n\nProvide box.\n\nI'll present derivation consistent: Using Q1 = 0.770 MeV for ^3He + n → ^3H + p, and Qβ = 0.018 MeV for ^3H → ^3He + e⁻ + ν̅, combine to eliminate nuclear masses leaving neutron – hydrogen atom.\n\nDerivation steps:\n\nEquation (1): M(^3He) + m_n = M(^3H) + m_p + Q1   (energy release adds to kinetic)\n=> m_n - m_p = Q1 + M(^3H) - M(^3He)\n\nEquation (2): M(^3H) = M(^3He) + m_e + Qβ    (rearranged from beta decay)\n\nInsert Eq2 into Eq1:\n\nm_n - m_p = Q1 + (M(^3He)+m_e+Qβ) - M(^3He) = Q1 + Qβ + m_e\n\nWait sign? Check original beta: Qβ = (M(^3H) - M(^3He) - m_e) c² . Rearranged: M(^3H) = M(^3He) + m_e + Qβ. Yes correct.\n\nPlugging: m_n - m_p = Q1 + Qβ + m_e.\n\nNumerically: Q1=0.770, Qβ=0.018, m_e≈0.511 => sum = 1.299 MeV. That's actually neutron–proton mass difference!

Decay into two-body states: K̅ N (antikaon + nucleon). The antikaon doublet: K¯ = (K− , \\bar K⁰ ) with I=½? Actually kaon anti-doublet forms I=½, third component: K− (I₃=-½), \\bar K⁰ (I₃=+½). Nucleon doublet p,n also I=½, p(I₃=+½), n(-½).\n\nCombine I(K̅)=½ ⊗ I(N)=½ gives total I=0 or 1. Since initial Σ has I=1, only I=1 part contributes; amplitude proportional to Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <½ m_K ; ½ m_N | 1 M>. For each channel we compute CGC magnitude squared ratio.\n\nSimilarly πN? Wait π⁻p final state: pion triplet I=1, components: π+,π0,π-. Combine with proton (I=½) yields I_total could be ½ or ³/₂ . Initial I=1 so both maybe allowed via mixing? But strong interaction conserves isospin overall but not necessarily same as initial because other possibilities may mix due to different coupling constants? However assuming single dominant reduced matrix element for given total I? Need more careful.\n\nBut perhaps they assume SU(3)? Not needed. Use isospin decomposition: Amplitude A ∝ sum over intermediate total I' times reduced amplitude T_I'. There might be multiple independent reduced amplitudes for each possible total I of final system. For K̅ N there are two possible I values (0,1); thus two reduced amplitudes. Similarly for π N have I=½, 3/2 giving two amplitudes. Without further info cannot determine ratios uniquely unless some selection rule picks one. Maybe assumption that decay proceeds through S-wave and parity etc leads to dominance of certain I? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively consider that Σ⁰ belongs to octet, its decays to KN belong to specific SU(3) couplings leading to particular linear combinations. Might be simpler: treat Σ⁰ → K̅ N as pure I=1 combination because Σ is member of isotriplet within octet, while K̅ N states decompose: |K⁻p> corresponds to I₃ = (-½)+(+½)=0. Same for |\\bar K⁰ n>: (+½)+(-½)=0. Both are mixtures of I=0 and I=1. Their relative amplitudes determined by CGCs:\n\n|I=1,I₃=0> = sqrt(1/2)(|K⁻p> - |\\bar K⁰ n>) ? Let's calculate using standard CG coefficients: combine i1=½,m1, i2=½,m2 -> total I=1,M=m1+m2.\n\nCGC: ⟨½ m1 ½ m2 | 1 M⟩.\n\nValues:\nM=1: m1=½,m2=½ => coeff √1 .\nM=0: combos (½,-½) and (-½,+½):\n⟨½ ½ ½ -½ | 1 0⟩ = +1/√2,\n⟨½ -½ ½ ½ | 1 0⟩ = -1/√2 (sign convention).\nThus |1,0> = (|½,½>|½,-½> - |½,-½>|½,½>)/√2 = (|K⁺?? wait mapping) We map first particle K̅ with I₃ = m1, second nucleon with m2.\n\nSo basis order: K̅ (m_K) then N (m_N). So |K⁻p> corresponds to m_K = -½, m_N = +½. That's the term |-½, +½>. Coefficient for this combo in |1,0> is -1/√2. While |\\bar K⁰ n> corresponds to +½, -½ with coefficient +1/√2.\n\nTherefore |1,0> = (|\\bar K⁰ n> - |K⁻ p>)/√2 .\n\nSimilarly |0,0> = (|\\bar K⁰ n> + |K⁻ p>)/√2.\n\nSince Σ⁰ has I=1, it couples only to I=1 component. Thus amplitude for Σ⁰→K⁻p equals -1/√2 * g where g is common reduced amplitude for I=1. Likewise amplitude for Σ⁰→\\bar K⁰ n = +1/√2 * g. Therefore rates proportional to square magnitudes: equal! Ratio Γ(\\bar K⁰ n)/Γ(K⁻ p) = 1.\n\nNow π⁻p final state: Pion I=1, nucleon I=½. Total I can be ½ or 3/2. Σ⁰ (I=1) can't couple directly to those totals? Wait total I of final must match initial I if isospin conserved. So we require combined I=1. But combining Iπ=1 with IN=½ you get I_tot = ½ or 3/2, never 1. Indeed addition 1⊕½ gives ½ and 3/2 only. No I=1. Hence direct strong decay Σ⁰ → π N violates isospin conservation. However observed decays exist via electromagnetic or weak? In reality Σ⁰(1385) decays strongly to Λπ, not πN. Here Σ⁰(1915) maybe higher resonance can decay to πN via isospin violation suppressed. Perhaps they ask to ignore isospin breaking? Then rate zero. Probably they expect ratio zero.\n\nCheck: Σ⁰ (I=1) cannot go to π N (total I ≠1). So amplitude vanishes under exact isospin symmetry ⇒ Γπ-p =0. So ratio zero.\n\nFinally π⁺π⁻ final state: Two pions together have total isospin either 0,1,2 (since each I=1). Combined with no extra particles, initial I=1 must match final I of dipion system which can be 0,1,2. So I=1 component present. Compute CGC for two-pion state with I=1, I₃=0 expressed in charge basis. Need probability amplitude for π⁺π⁻ component in I=1 state.\n\nTwo identical bosons? They are distinguishable charges though. Symmetrization matters but okay.\n\nConstruct |I=1, I₃=0> from two I=1 particles. Using CG coefficients: ⟨1 m_a 1 m_b | 1 0⟩.\n\nPossible pairs (m_a,m_b) with sum 0: (1,-1),(0,0),(-1,1). Correspond to (π⁺,π⁻), (π⁰,π⁰), (π⁻,π⁺). CGC values: From tables, ⟨1 1 1 -1 | 1 0⟩ = +1/√2 ; ⟨1 0 1 0 | 1 0⟩ = 0 ; ⟨1 -1 1 1 | 1 0⟩ = -1/√2 . Sign conventions again. So symmetric combination: (|π⁺π⁻> - |π⁻π⁺>)/√2 . Because pions are bosons, physical state should be symmetrized, but antisymmetric in exchange would vanish for identical bosons? Yet charge labels differentiate them, swapping just exchanges positions, wavefunction includes spatial part symmetrical for s-wave, making overall symmetric required. Antisymmetric charge part would make total antisymmetry requiring odd orbital angular momentum. Could still occur. Anyway amplitude magnitude for π⁺π⁻ will involve factor 1/√2 difference between ordered vs unordered?\n\nIf we count distinct final state without ordering, the probability weight for observing π⁺π⁻ pair irrespective of labeling is twice the modulus-squared of coefficient for ordered state? Usually decay rate counts indistinguishable permutations accounted by phase space factor. We'll approximate that amplitude for unordered π⁺π⁻ is √2 times coefficient? Simpler: The fraction of I=1 component that appears as charged pair is 1 (since only charged combination enters). Actually the normalized I=1 state contains superposition of π⁺π⁻ minus π⁻π⁺ which cancels when considering unordered detection. This suggests that I=1 does NOT contain symmetric charged pair, meaning decay to π⁺π⁻ requires L odd (P-wave) to make overall symmetric. Possibly non-zero.\n\nGiven complexity, likely they'd want ratio based on CGC squares ignoring Bose statistics: Probability proportion to |coeff|² summed over contributions yielding π⁺π⁻. Ordered states give two terms each with 1/2 contribution, total probability = (1/2)+(1/2)=1. So branching ratio equal to that of any I=1 final state like K̅ N? But normalization of I=1 state among three possible charge configurations? Number of charge states for I=1: three (π⁺π⁰?, actually need two pions). Different charge combos produce I=1: π⁺π⁰, π⁰π⁻, plus mixture? Hard.\n\nMaybe easier: Decompose product representation: 3⊗3 = 1⊕3⊕5. Dimensions: singlet (I=0) dim1, triplet (I=1) dim3, quintet (I=2) dim5. Among the nine possible charge combinations (including repeats), the I=1 subspace dimension 3. How many of those correspond to π⁺π⁻? Count multiplicities: Basis states: |π⁺π⁻>, |π⁻π⁺>, |π⁰π⁰>, |π⁺π⁰>, |π⁰π⁺>, |π⁰π⁻>, |π⁻π⁰>, |π⁺π⁺>, |π⁻π⁻>. Only ones with net I₃=0 relevant: |π⁺π⁻>, |π⁻π⁺>, |π⁰π⁰>. These span the I=0,1,2 spaces. Within I=1 subspace, the orthogonal combination to I=0 and I=2 leaves something. As earlier, I=0 state is (|π⁺π⁻>+|π⁻π⁺>+|π⁰π⁰>)/√3. I=2, I₃=0 state is (|π⁺π⁻>+|π⁻π⁺>-2|π⁰π⁰>)/√6. Subtract appropriate to isolate I=1: It becomes (|π⁺π⁻>-|π⁻π⁺>)/√2. So indeed I=1 involves antisymmetric combination of charged states, no π⁰π⁰. Unordered measurement sees both orders equally, resulting probability proportional to |1/√2|² + |‑1/√2|² = 1. Normalizing total I=1 norm =1. So the overlap squared with unordered π⁺π⁻ is 1. That means full strength goes to charged pair? Seems plausible.\n\nHence decay width to π⁺π⁻ (unordered) equals reduced amplitude squared times 1. Compare to K̅ N case where each mode got half of total I=1 amplitude? Actually for K̅ N, the I=1 state gave equal magnitude to each channel (±1/√2). Sum of probabilities for both channels = (1/2)+(1/2)=1. So each individual channel gets 1/2 of total. For π⁺π⁻ unordered, it's effectively both orderings counted as same final state, giving total prob 1. So ratio Γ(π⁺π⁻)/Γ(K⁻p) = (full)/(half) = 2.\n\nThus expected ratios: Γ_{\\bar K⁰ n}/Γ_{K⁻p}=1, Γ_{π⁻p}=0, Γ_{π⁺π⁻}/Γ_{K⁻p}=2.\n\nLet's deliver.\n\nassistantfinalUsing isospin symmetry the decay amplitudes are obtained from the Clebsch–Gordan\ndecomposition of the final‐state isospins.\n\n---\n\n### 1.   \\( \\Sigma^{0}(1915)\\to \\bar K\\,N\\)\n\n\\( \\bar K\\;(I=\\tfrac12,\\;I_{3})\\) :  \n\\(K^{-}\\;(I_{3}=-\\tfrac12 ),\\qquad \\bar K^{0}\\;(I_{3}=+\\tfrac12 )\\)\n\n\\( N\\;(I=\\tfrac12,\\;I_{3})\\) :   \n\\(p\\;(I_{3}=+\\tfrac12 ),\\qquad n\\;(I_{3}=-\\tfrac12 )\\)\n\nCoupling \\( \\tfrac12\\otimes\\tfrac12 =0\\oplus 1\\).  \nOnly the \\(I=1\\) piece matches the parent’s isospin (\\(I=1,\\;I_{3}=0\\)) :\n\n\\[\n|1,0\\rangle=\n\\frac{|\\,\\bar K^{0}n\\rangle-|\\,K^{-}p\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\; .\n\\]\n\nHence  \n\n\\[\n\\mathcal M(\\Sigma^{0}\\!\\to\\!K^{-}p)= -\\frac{g}{\\sqrt{2}},\n\\qquad    \n\\mathcal M(\\Sigma^{0}\\!\\to\\!\\bar K^{0}n)= \\frac{g}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nwith a common reduced amplitude \\(g\\).  \nConsequently  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \n\\frac{\\Gamma_{\\bar K^{0}n}}{\\Gamma_{K^{-}p}}=1 } .\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 2.   \\( \\Sigma^{0}(1915)\\to \\pi N\\)\n\nFor the pion \\(I_\\pi =1\\) and the nucleon \\(I_N=\\tfrac12\\),\n\n\\[\n1\\otimes \\tfrac12 = \\tfrac12\\;\\oplus\\;\\tfrac32 ,\n\\]\n\nso **no** total isospin \\(I=1\\) occurs.

{"id": "atomic/2-48", "questions": "If the nuclear force is charge independent and a neutron and a proton form a bound state, then why is there no bound state for two neutrons? What information does this provide on the nucleon-nucleon force?  ", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to explain that nuclear (strong) force is approximately charge-independent but also depends on spin/isospin; deuteron exists as pn bound with total isospin I=0, while nn or pp have I=1 states which are not bound due to lack of sufficient attraction because of Pauli principle etc. Also electromagnetic repulsion between protons prevents binding. For neutrons, they don't feel Coulomb, yet still no dineutron bound because the NN interaction has different components: central potential plus tensor component from pion exchange leads to strong attraction only in certain spin-isospin channel (^3S_1 - ^3D_1 coupled). The dineutron would be in ^1S_0 (spin singlet), where scattering length is large negative indicating near-threshold virtual state but not bound. So info: the NN force is attractive overall but its strength varies with spin and isospin; it's more attractive in triplet (I=0) than singlet (I=1); indicates presence of tensor forces and dependence on spin coupling.\n\nThus answer: despite approximate charge independence, the existence of bound deuteron vs none for nn tells us about the isospin dependence: the np system can couple to both I=0 and I=1, but the bound state occurs in I=0, S=1 channel. Two identical fermions must obey antisymmetry leading to symmetric spatial wavefunction requiring odd L if spin-singlet? Actually for s-wave (L=0) symmetry requires combined spin*isospin antisymmetric. For nn pair, isospin T=1 (symmetric), so spin must be antisymmetric => S=0. That gives ^1S0 channel which is less attractive. Therefore no bound state. This provides constraints on potentials used e.g., one-pion-exchange predicts stronger attraction in triplet channel.\n\nProvide explanation and concluding box with statement like \"The absence of a dineutron shows that the NN force is not purely scalar; it depends on spin–isospin, being sufficiently attractive only in the \\(^{3}S_{1}\\!-\\!{}^{3}D_{1}\\) (T=0,S=1) channel.\"\n\nLet's craft full response with steps.assistantfinal**Step‑by‑step reasoning**\n\n1. **Charge‐independence ≠ complete degeneracy**  \n   “Charge independence’’ means that the *isoscalar* part of the nucleon–nucleon (\\(NN\\)) interaction is the same whether we replace a proton by a neutron.

For Pb-208, atomic number Z=82, mass number A=208. One-electron system => hydrogenic ion Pb^81+. So we consider Coulomb potential modified inside sphere of uniform charge distribution radius R.\n\nPart (a): Potential V(r). Outside (r>R), same as point charge: V_out = -Ze^2/(4π ε0 r). Inside (r<R), use Gauss law for uniform volume charge density ρ = Ze / ((4/3) π R^3). Electric field E(r)= (1/(4π ε0)) * (Q_enclosed)/r^2 radially outward; Q_enc = ρ*(4/3)π r^3 = Ze (r^3/R^3). Then magnitude E = (1/(4π ε0))* (Ze r)/(R^3). Direction radial outward from center. Potential relative zero at infinity: integrate inward: V_in(r) = -∫_{∞}^{r}E·dr' . But easier: continuity at r=R gives constant offset. Known result: V_inside(r) = -(Ze)/(8π ε0 R)[3 - (r^2/R^2)]. Actually standard formula for uniformly charged sphere: potential inside (relative to ∞) is V(r) = (Ze)/(8π ε0 R)*(3 - (r^2/R^2)), but sign negative because electron sees attractive potential: V(r) = - (Ze)/(8π ε0 R)(3 - r^2/R^2).\n\nCheck: At surface r=R, V(R) = - (Ze)/(8π ε0 R)(3 -1) = - (Ze)/(4π ε0 R) which matches external value -Ze/(4π ε0 R). Good.\n\nThus part (a) done.\n\nPart (b): Level shift ΔE = ⟨ψ|δV|ψ⟩ where δV = V_actual - V_pointlike. Since outside region unchanged, only difference within r<R. Use unperturbed hydrogenic 1s wavefunction for high-Z hydrogenic ion: ψ_{100}(r) = (Z_eff/a0)^{3/2}/√π e^{-Z_eff r / a0}, where a0 = ħ²/(me e²) ≈ 0.529 Å, Z_eff = Z (since single electron around bare nucleus). However relativistic corrections maybe small? We'll treat nonrelativistically.\n\nGiven assumption R << a0/Z (Bohr radius scaled by Z?), actually Bohr radius for hydrogenic ion is a_B/Z. Indeed ground-state radius ~ a0/Z. For lead Z=82, a0/Z≈0.00645 Å =6.45e-13 m = 645 fm. Nuclear radius ~7 fm, so indeed R<<a0/Z. Therefore wavefunction approximately constant over nuclear interior: ψ(0) approx value at origin: |ψ(0)|^2 = (Z^3)/(π a0^3). More precisely, average over sphere yields similar.\n\nPotential correction δV(r) = V_in(r)-(-Ze^2/(4π ε0 r)). Compute expression: δV(r) = - (Ze)/(8π ε0 R)(3 - r^2/R^2)+ Ze/(4π ε0 r). Simplify factor Ze/(4π ε0):\n\nLet k = Ze/(4π ε0). Then V_point = -k/r. V_in = -k/(2R)(3 - r^2/R^2). Wait check coefficient: earlier V_in = - (Ze)/(8π ε0 R)(3 - r^2/R^2) = -k/(2R)(3 - r^2/R^2). Because k = Ze/(4π ε0); dividing by 2R gives Ze/(8π ε0 R). Yes.\n\nSo δV = -k/(2R)(3 - r^2/R^2) + k/r.\n\nCompute expectation integral: ΔE = ∫_0^R |ψ(r)|^2 δV(r) d³r.\n\nSince ψ varies slowly, approximate |ψ(r)|^2 ≈ |ψ(0)|^2 = (Z^3)/(π a0^3). Then integration reduces to |ψ(0)|^2 ∫_0^R δV(r) 4π r^2 dr.\n\nLet's compute I = ∫_0^R [k/r - k/(2R)(3 - r^2/R^2)] 4π r^2 dr.\n\nFactor out k*4π:\n\nI = 4π k ∫_0^R [ r - (1/(2R))(3 - r^2/R^2) r^2 ] dr ?\n\nWait careful: term k/r times r^2 -> k r ; second term: -k/(2R)(3 - r^2/R^2)* r^2 .\n\nActually δV includes plus k/r minus ... Let's write integrand: (k/r) - (k/(2R))(3 - r^2/R^2). Multiply by 4π r^2:\n\nTerm1: 4π k r^2 *(1/r) = 4π k r.\n\nTerm2: -4π k /(2R) (3 - r^2/R^2) r^2 = -2π k /R (3 r^2 - r^4/R^2)\n\nNow integrate from 0 to R.\n\nFirst term integral: ∫_0^R 4π k r dr = 4π k * (R^2/2) = 2π k R^2.\n\nSecond term: Integral of -2π k /R (3 r^2 - r^4/R^2) dr.\n\nCompute ∫_0^R 3 r^2 dr = 3 * R^3/3 = R^3.\n\n∫_0^R r^4 dr = R^5/5.\n\nTherefore second contribution = -2π k /R [ R^3 - (R^5/5)/R^2 ? wait r^4/R^2 integrated becomes (1/R^2) ∫ r^4 dr = (1/R^2) * R^5/5 = R^3/5 ]\n\nHence bracket: 3 r^2 - r^4/R^2 integrates to R^3 - R^3/5 = (4/5) R^3.\n\nMultiply: -2π k /R * (4/5) R^3 = -2π k * (4/5) R^2 = -(8/5) π k R^2.\n\nAdd first term: 2π k R^2 - (8/5) π k R^2 = (10/5 - 8/5) π k R^2 = (2/5) π k R^2.\n\nThus I = (2/5) π k R^2.\n\nThen ΔE = |ψ(0)|^2 * I = (Z^3)/(π a0^3) * (2/5) π k R^2 = (2/5) Z^3 k R^2 / a0^3.\n\nCancel π.\n\nRecall k = Ze^2/(4π ε0) = Z α ħ c ??? In SI units energy: k = Z e^2/(4π ε0) = Z ℏc α. Using natural constants: e^2/(4π ε0) = αħc ≈ 197.326 MeV·fm × α?? Actually α≈1/137, ħc≈197.327 MeV·fm, product αħc≈1.44 MeV·fm. That's convenient: e^2/(4π ε0) = 1.44 MeV·fm.\n\nThus k = Z * 1.44 MeV·fm.\n\nPlugging: ΔE = (2/5) Z^3 * (Z * 1.44 MeV·fm) * R^2 / a0^3 = (2/5) Z^4 * 1.44 MeV·fm * R^2 / a0^3.\n\nBut note a0 expressed in fm: a0 = 0.529 Å = 0.529×10⁻¹⁰ m = 5.29×10⁴ fm? Actually 1 fm = 1e-15 m, so a0 = 5.29e-11 m = 5.29e4 fm. Yes a0 = 5.29177e4 fm.\n\nThus a0^3 = (5.29e4)^3 fm^3 ≈ 1.48e14 fm^3.\n\nNow plug numbers for Lead: Z=82, A=208, R = r0 A^(1/3) with r0=1.2 fm. Compute A^(1/3): 208^(1/3). Approx cube root: 5.94 (since 6^3=216). So R ≈ 1.2 * 5.94 = 7.128 fm.\n\nNow calculate ΔE in MeV.\n\nFirst compute Z^4: 82^4. 82^2=6724, then squared again: 6724^2 ≈ (6700+24)^2 = 6700^2 +2*6700*24 +24^2 = 44.89e6 +321600 +576 ≈ 45.212176e6 ≈ 45.21 million. Let's compute more accurately: 6724*6724. 6724*6000=40,344,000; *700=4,706,800; *20=134,480; *4=26,896 sum =45,212,176. yes.\n\nNow compute prefactor (2/5)*1.44 MeV·fm = (0.4)*1.44 = 0.576 MeV·fm.\n\nThus ΔE = 0.576 MeV·fm * Z^4 * R^2 / a0^3.\n\nCalculate numerator: Z^4 * R^2 = 45,212,176 * (7.128 fm)^2.\n\nR^2 = 50.80 fm^2 (approx). Multiply: 45,212,176 * 50.8 ≈ 45.212e6 * 50.8 ≈ (45.212e6 * 5.08e1) = 45.212e6 * 50.8 = let's do: 45,212,176 * 50 = 2,260,608,800; plus 0.8*45,212,176 = 36,169,741; total ≈ 2,296,778,541 ≈ 2.30e9 fm^2.\n\nMore precise: add also 0.0? fine.\n\nNow multiply by 0.576 MeV·fm: ΔE_numerical = 0.576 * 2.297e9 MeV·fm^3 = 1.322e9 MeV·fm^3.\n\nDivide by a0^3 = 1.48e14 fm^3 → ΔE = 1.322e9 / 1.48e14 MeV = 8.93e-6 MeV = 8.9 μeV.\n\nConvert to cm^-1: 1 eV corresponds to 8065.544005 cm^-1. Thus 1 MeV = 8.0655e6 cm^-1. So ΔE(cm^-1) = 8.93e-6 MeV * 8.0655e6 cm^-1/MeV = 8.93e-6 * 8.0655e6 = 72.0 cm^-1? Let's compute: 8.0655e6 * 8.93e-6 = 8.0655 * 8.93 ≈ 71.99. Yes about 72 cm^-1.\n\nThat seems plausible order-of-magnitude for isotope shifts etc.\n\nThus answer (c): Approximately 70 cm^{-1}.

Part (a): describe pp-chain primary process: p + p -> d + e+ + ν_e; then deuterium plus proton etc leading to He-4 via three branches (ppI, ppII, ppIII). Slowest step is first one: two protons fuse via weak interaction producing deuteron, positron, neutrino. Mean energy of neutrinos from pp chain ~0.26 MeV average? Actually pp neutrinos up to 0.42 MeV with avg about 0.265 MeV. Also other components like Be7 electron capture gives monoenergetic 0.862 MeV line, B8 beta decay yields high-energy up to 15 MeV but small flux. Principal component = pp neutrinos (~90% of total flux). Number flux estimate using solar luminosity L_sun ≈3.846e26 W.

Flux = 1.8e38 / 2.81e23 ≈6.4e14 m⁻² s⁻¹ = 6.4×10^10 cm⁻² s⁻¹. That's standard value ~6×10^10 cm⁻²s⁻¹.\n\nMean energy of neutrinos: weighted over all components maybe around 0.3 MeV. Could state approx 0.26 MeV.\n\nPart (b): Minor reactions: CNO cycle (carbon-nitrogen-oxygen) also contributes <2%. Or specifically the ^8B β+ decay from ppIII branch: ^7Be(p,γ)^8B → ^8B→ ^8Be* + e+ + ν_e giving high-energy neutrinos up to 15 MeV. Also pep reaction (p+e+p->d+ν) gives 1.44 MeV line. And hep reaction (^3He + p → ^4He + e+ + ν) gives highest energies up to 18.8 MeV though tiny flux.\n\nDescribe detection method: Radiochemical chlorine-argon experiment: target 615 tons of tetrachloroethylene containing 2.2x10^30 Cl-35 nuclei. Neutrinos convert ^37Cl to ^37Ar via inverse beta. After exposure period (~few weeks/months), Ar extracted by flushing gas through the tank, captured on charcoal, counted via proportional counters detecting Auger electrons from K-capture decays (half-life 35 days). Results: observed rate ~0.5 SNU vs predicted ~7–8 SNU (solar neutrino problem). Later experiments confirmed deficit (Kamiokande, Super-Kamiokande, SAGE, GALLEX/GNO).\n\nProvide brief discussion of results: measured flux roughly factor 3 lower than predictions, indicating either problems with solar models or neutrino properties – later resolved by neutrino oscillations.\n\nNow craft final answer with LaTeX box.assistantfinal**Answer**\n\n---\n\n### (a) The dominant source of solar energy  \n\n| Step | Reaction (illustrative) | Remarks |\n|------|------------------------|---------|\n| **1**   | \\(p+p\\;\\longrightarrow\\;{\\rm D}+e^{+}+\\nu_{e}\\)                | Weak‑interaction “fusion” of two protons; **slowest link** because it requires conversion of a proton into a neutron. |\n| **2**   | \\({\\rm D}+p\\;\\longrightarrow\\;{}^{3}{\\rm He}+\\gamma\\)          | Strong EM capture, very fast. |\n| **3**   | \\({}^{3}{\\rm He}+{}^{3}{\\rm He}\\;\\longrightarrow\\;{}^{4}{\\rm He}+2p\\) (pp‑I) | One possible termination; there are also pp‑II (\\(^3\\!{\\rm He}+\\,^{4}{\\rm He}\\to {}^{7}{\\rm Be}+ \\gamma\\); … ) and pp‑III (\\(^7{\\rm Be}+p\\to {}^{8}{\\rm B}\\)). |\n\nFour protons are ultimately converted into one \\({ }^{4}{\\rm He}\\) nucleus,\nreleasing a total energy  \n\\(Q\\simeq 26.7\\ {\\rm MeV}=4.27\\times10^{-12}\\ {\\rm J}\\)\n(the released photons carry only \\(\\approx 26.2\\ {\\rm MeV}\\);\nthe remainder leaves the Sun carried away by the emitted neutrinos).\n\n#### Mean energy of the neutrinos\n\nIn the **principal component**, i.e. the pp‑chain, most neutrinos come from the\nfirst step (pp‑reaction).

Elastic electron scattering  \n\nAn incident relativistic electron (\\(e^{-}\\)) scatters elastically from a target nucleus. The detector records the **differential cross‑section**\n\\[\n\\frac{{\\rm d}\\sigma}{{\\rm d}\\Omega}(E,\\theta)\n\\]\nas a function of the laboratory scattering angle \\(\\theta\\) (or equivalently as a function of the four‑momentum transfer squared \n\\(Q^{2}= -\\,q^{2}=4 E^{2}\\sin ^{2}{\\tfrac{\\theta }{2}}\\)).   \n\nFor a spin‑zero (or spherically averaged) nucleus the one‑photon exchange approximation gives  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\frac{{\\rm d}\\sigma_{\\!el}}{{\\rm d}\\Omega}\n=\n\\left[\\frac{{\\rm d}\\sigma}_{\\text {Mott}} \\right]\\,\\bigl|F(Q^{2})\\bigr|^{2}}\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* \\({\\rm d}\\sigma_{\\text Mott}\\) is the point‑like Rutherford/Mott cross‑section,\n* \\(F(Q^{2})\\) is the **elastic electric form factor**, i.e. the spatial Fourier transform of the static charge density \\(\\rho(r)\\):\n\\[\nF(Q^{2})=\\int {\\rm d}^{3}r\\;\\rho(r)\\,e^{i\\mathbf q\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathbf r}.\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nBecause the integral is normalized, \\(F(0)=1\\).

Spectroscopy of muonic atoms  \n\nA negative muon (\\(\\mu^{-}\\), mass \\(m_\\mu\\simeq207\\,m_e\\)) captured into an atomic orbit around a nucleus forms a hydrogen‑like system whose Bohr radius is reduced by the same factor \\(m_\\mu/m_e\\). Consequently the muon's wavefunction penetrates deeply into the nuclear volume, making the bound‑state energies extremely sensitive to the **finite extent of the nuclear charge distribution**.\n\nExperimentally one measures **transition energies between low‑lying states**, most commonly the \\(2p\\rightarrow1s\\) x‑ray line. Denote the observed frequency (or energy) by \\(E_{nl}^{\\text{exp}}\\). In the limit of a point‑like nucleus quantum electrodynamics predicts a value \\(E_{nl}^{\\text{pt}}\\); the difference\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_{nl}=E_{nl}^{\\text{exp}}-E_{nl}^{\\text{pt}}\n\\]\n\nis called the **finite‑size correction**.

Their differences contain contributions from the Coulomb interaction among protons, which indeed depend on the spatial distribution of charge. However, the extracted quantity is a combination of many effects (Coulomb self‑energy, symmetry energy, pairing, shell corrections, …). One would have to invoke detailed nuclear‑structure models to isolate the dependence on \\(\\langle r^{2}\\rangle\\). Hence it provides **only an indirect constraint** rather than a clean observable like a scattering cross‑section or an atomic transition frequency.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Summary  \n\n| Experiment | Measured Physical Quantity | How it relates to the nuclear radius |\n|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Elastic electron scattering** | Differential cross‑section \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{{\\rm d}\\sigma}{{\\rm d}\\Omega}(E,\\theta)\\) ⇒ Form factor \\(F(Q^{2})\\) | Slope at \\(Q^{2}=0:\\; \\langle r^{2}\\rangle =-6\\,\\partial F/\\partial Q^{2}|_{0}\\) |\n| **Muonium / Muonic atom spectroscopy** | Transition energy shifts \\(\\Delta E_{nl}\\) (e.g. \\(2p\\!\\to\\!1s\\) x‑ray) | Directly proportional to \\(\\langle r^{2}\\rangle\\): see Eq.(5)–(7) |\n\nBoth methods yield the **root‑mean‑square charge radius** \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{R\\;=\\;\\sqrt{\\langle r^{2}\\rangle }}\n\\]\n\nwhich characterises the overall size of the nuclear charge distribution."}

For free nucleon values: gp^l=1, gn^l=0; gp^s = 5.586, gn^s=-3.826 (since µp = (gp^l + gp^s)/2 etc). But using nuclear magneton units we can write μ = ∑_i (μ_N)[ (g_l^(i)) l_i + (g_s^(i))/2 σ_i ]. Usually use sigma instead of spin vector S = ħσ/2 . So expression.\n\nPart (b): Define isospin operator τ_i with third component τz = +1/2 for proton, -1/2 for neutron. Then separate into isoscalar (I=0) part proportional to identity in isospin space and isovector (I=1) part proportional to τ_z. The coefficients: g_l = (1/2)(g_l^p + g_l^n)+ (τ_z)_i * (1/2)(g_l^p - g_l^n); similarly for g_s. Since g_l^p=1,g_l^n=0 => average ½ ; difference ½ . So isoscalar orbital term coefficient ½ , isovector coefficient (τ_z)*½ . For spin terms: g_s^p≈5.5857, g_s^n≈−3.8263 → avg ≈0.8797, diff ≈4.706. Thus isoscalar spin factor ~0.88, isovector ~2.35 times τ_z (because half diff?). Actually (g_s^p ± g_s^n)/2 gives iso scalar = (5.5857-3.8263)/2?? Wait compute: (5.5857 + (-3.8263))/2 = (1.7594)/2 =0.8797. Difference over 2: (5.5857 - (-3.8263))/2 = (9.412)/2 =4.706. So isovector coefficient multiplies τ_z.\n\nRelative size: Isovector dominates because about five times larger than isoscalar for spin term; orbital only contributes via isoscalar (½) plus small isovector (½ τ_z).\n\nThus overall magnitude ratio roughly (isoscalar : isovector) ≈ (0.5 from orbit +0.88 from spin) vs (0.5 τ_z +4.71 τ_z ) -> approx 1.38 vs 5.21 per unit τ_z. So isovector bigger.\n\nPart (c): Need to show formula for sum of magnetic moments of T=1/2 mirrors. Mirror pair have same J but opposite projection of isospin: one has N=Z+1 (more neutrons), other Z=N+1. Use expectation value of operator derived earlier. Sum μ_total = ⟨Ψ|∑ μ_i |Ψ⟩ for each member then add. Using decomposition into isoscalar + isovector parts, note that isoscalar contribution adds twice, while isovector changes sign between members due to τ_z→ -τ_z. Therefore sum eliminates isovector piece except those multiplied by τ_z which change sign leading to cancellation? Let's derive:\n\nMagnetic moment operator expressed as μ = μ_N ∑ [ (g_l^S + g_l^V τ_z)i l_i + (g_s^S + g_s^V τ_z)i (σ_i /2) ]\n\nTake expectation value in state with good total angular momentum J and isospin T=1/2, M_T = +/- 1/2 for the two mirrors. Denote <...>_M_T.\n\nSum: μ(+1/2) + μ(-1/2)= 2 μ_S + 0*??? Actually isovector contributions cancel if they are linear in τ_z. However there may also be term independent of τ_z after taking matrix element of σ·? Wait given result includes term involving ⟨Σ σ_z⟩ multiplied by (µ_p+µ_n - 1/2). That suggests some residual isovector effect remains due to combination of g factors not purely symmetric.\n\nLet's compute directly using single-particle approximation? Not needed; general operator leads to expression.\n\nWrite individual nucleon's magnetic moment in units μ_N: μ_i = (1/2)(1+τ_z,i) (ℓ_i + g_s^p σ_i/2?) Hmm better start from known relation: For any nucleon,\n\nμ_i = [(1+τ_z,i)/2] ( ℓ_i + g_s^p σ_i/2 ) + [(1-τ_z,i)/2] ( g_s^n σ_i/2 ), since neutron has no charge so no orbital term.\n\nSimplify: μ_i = (ℓ_i/2)(1+τ_z,i) + (σ_i/2)[ (g_s^p (1+τ_z,i) + g_s^n (1-τ_z,i))/2 ] .\n\nNow sum over all nucleons. Separate into isoscalar/isovector pieces.\n\nDefine total orbital L = Σ ℓ_i, total spin Σ σ_i.\n\nThen μ_sum = (1/2)L + (1/2) Σ τ_z,i ℓ_i + (1/4)[ (g_s^p+g_s^n) Σ σ_i + (g_s^p-g_s^n) Σ τ_z,i σ_i ].\n\nFor mirror nuclei, expectation values of Σ τ_z,i ℓ_i vanish (?) Because total orbital angular momentum couples to spatial symmetry maybe zero net? In many cases ground states dominated by LS coupling giving L aligned with J? Might get simplification: Expectation of L along quantization axis equals J - Σ S? Anyway final expression provided uses J and Σ σ_z.\n\nRecall total angular momentum J = L + S, with S = (1/2) Σ σ. Hence its z-component expectation: ⟨J_z⟩ = m_J = J (for stretched state). Taking expectation in maximal m=J state yields ⟨L_z⟩ + (1/2)⟨Σ σ_z⟩ = J.\n\nTherefore ⟨L_z⟩ = J - (1/2)⟨Σ σ_z⟩.\n\nPlug into μ_sum expression for the two mirrors: sum of μ's = ⟨ ... ⟩_+ + ⟨ ... ⟩_- . Terms containing Σ τ_z,i ℓ_i and Σ τ_z,i σ_i will cancel because τ_z flips sign between mirrors (overall expectation of τ_z becomes ±1/2). Their sum vanishes. Remaining terms: (1/2)⟨L_z⟩ (twice) + (1/4)(g_s^p+g_s^n)⟨Σ σ_z⟩ (twice). Multiply by 2: total = ⟨L_z⟩ + (1/2)(g_s^p+g_s^n)⟨Σ σ_z⟩.\n\nReplace ⟨L_z⟩ using above: = J - (1/2)⟨Σ σ_z⟩ + (1/2)(g_s^p+g_s^n)⟨Σ σ_z⟩ = J + [ (g_s^p+g_s^n)/2 - 1/2 ] ⟨Σ σ_z⟩.\n\nBut recall magnetic moments of free nucleons relate to g_factors: μ_p = (1 + g_s^p)/2, μ_n = (g_s^n)/2 (since neutron has no orbital). Indeed μ_p = (1 + g_s^p)/2, μ_n = g_s^n/2. Solve for (g_s^p+g_s^n)/2 = μ_p + μ_n - 1/2. Check: μ_p + μ_n = (1+g_s^p)/2 + g_s^n/2 = (1 + g_s^p + g_s^n)/2 ⇒ subtract 1/2 gives (g_s^p+g_s^n)/2.

Volume term \\(a_{\\!v}A\\)\n\n*Physical picture.* The short‑range attractive nuclear force saturates: each nucleon interacts only with its nearest neighbours. Consequently the bulk contribution to the binding energy grows linearly with the number of nucleons, just like the cohesive energy of molecules in a liquid drop.\n\n*Scaling.* No dependence on shape or size beyond the factor \\(A\\); therefore it appears simply as proportional to \\(A\\).\n\n*Typical value.* From data one finds  \n\n\\[\na_{\\!v}=15.7\\text{--}16.0~\\mathrm{MeV}.\n\\]\n\nThus a nucleus of \\(A=100\\) would have roughly \\(1600\\,\\rm MeV\\) of binding coming from this term alone.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2. Surface term \\(-a_{\\!s}A^{2/3}\\)\n\n*Physical picture.* Nucleons lying on the surface lack some of their neighbour interactions present in the interior, reducing the net attraction. This loss scales with the area of the nuclear \"drop\".\n\n*Scaling.* For a sphere of radius \\(R=r_0A^{1/3}\\) the surface area is \\(4\\pi R^{2}\\propto A^{2/3}\\). Hence the reduction in binding should go as \\(\\sim A^{2/3}\\).\n\n*Typical value.*\n\n\\[\na_{\\!s}=17\\text{--}19~\\mathrm{MeV},\n\\qquad\\text{commonly }a_{\\!s}\\approx 18.3~\\mathrm{MeV}.\n\\]\n\nIt subtracts about \\(300\\;\\rm MeV\\) for a heavy nucleus such as \\(^{208}{\\rm Pb}\\).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 3. Coulomb term \\(-a_{\\!c}\\dfrac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}}\\)\n\n*Physical picture.* Protons repel via the long‑range electrostatic interaction. In a uniformly charged sphere the self‑energy is  \n\n\\[\nE_{\\rm C}= \\frac{3e^{2}}{5r_{0}}\\,\\frac{Z^{2}}{A^{1/3}},\n\\]\n\nso the larger the charge and the smaller the radius, the greater the penalty.\n\n*Why \\(Z(Z-1)\\)?* Each distinct pair of protons contributes once; there are \\(Z(Z-1)/2\\) pairs, but the conventional constant absorbs the factor \\(1/2\\).\n\n*Scaling.* Since \\(R\\propto A^{1/3}\\), the Coulomb energy varies as \\(Z^{2}/A^{1/3}\\). Often the more accurate combination \\(Z(Z-1)\\) replaces \\(Z^{2}\\) to avoid counting a proton’s self‑interaction.\n\n*Typical value.*\n\n\\[\na_{\\!c}=0.69\\text{--}0.72~\\mathrm{MeV},\\quad\\text{often quoted }a_{\\!c}=0.714~\\mathrm{MeV}.\n\\]\n\nIn lead (\\(Z=82,A=208\\)) this term removes roughly \\(900\\;\\rm MeV\\) from the binding.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 4. Asymmetry (or “symmetry”) term \\(-a_{\\!a}\\dfrac{(N-Z)^{2}}{A}\\)\n\n*Physical picture.* The nuclear force is almost independent of whether a nucleon is a neutron or a proton (isospin symmetry). However, because of the Pauli exclusion principle the Fermi energies of neutrons and protons differ when the numbers are unequal, raising the overall kinetic energy. The most stable configuration for a given \\(A\\) thus has equal numbers of neutrons and protons; deviations cost energy quadratically.\n\n*Scaling.* Treating neutrons and protons as two degenerate Fermi gases gives a kinetic‐energy excess proportional to \\((N-Z)^{2}/A\\). Therefore the term enters as shown.\n\n*Typical value.*\n\n\\[\na_{\\!a}=22\\text{--}24~\\mathrm{MeV},\\quad\\text{standard choice }a_{\\!a}=23.2~\\mathrm{MeV}.\n\\]\n\nFor a light nucleus far from the valley of stability (e.g., \\(^{14}_{6}{\\rm C}\\)), this term may contribute several hundred MeV.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 5. Pairing term \\(\\displaystyle \\pm\\delta(A)=\\begin{cases}\n+\\dfrac{a_{\\!p}}{A^{1/2}}, & {\\rm even\\;Z,\\;even\\;N}\\\\[4pt]\n-\\dfrac{a_{\\!p}}{A^{1/2}}, & {\\rm odd\\;Z,\\;odd\\;N}\\\\[4pt]\n0,                         & {\\rm otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\\)\n\n*Physical picture.* Empirically, nuclei with both even \\(Z\\) *and* even \\(N\\) are especially tightly bound, while those with both odd are less so. This reflects the tendency of identical nucleons to couple into spin‑zero Cooper‑like pairs, gaining additional correlation energy.\n\n*Scaling.* The effect diminishes for heavier systems because the fraction of paired nucleons relative to the total falls roughly as \\(A^{-1/2}\\). Thus a convenient phenomenological form is \\(a_{p}/A^{1/2}\\).\n\n*Typical value.*\n\n\\[\na_{\\!p}\\approx 11\\text{--}12~\\mathrm{MeV},\n\\qquad\\text{most often }a_{\\!p}=12.0~\\mathrm{MeV}.\n\\]\n\nHence for \\(A=50\\) the pairing correction is about \\(\\pm 1.7\\;\\rm MeV\\).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Putting everything together  \n\nIf one wishes to write directly the nuclear **mass**, use  \n\n\\[\nM(A,Z)=Zm_{p}+Nm_{n}-\\frac{B(A,Z)}{c^{2}},\n\\]\n\nwith \\(B(A,Z)\\) supplied by Eq.(1).  \nNumerical fitting to thousands of measured nuclide masses yields the set of coefficients commonly employed today:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{\\!v}&\\simeq 15.75\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\\na_{\\!s}&\\simeq 17.80\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\\na_{\\!c}&\\simeq 0.71\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\\na_{\\!a}&\\simeq 23.20\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\\na_{\\!p}&\\simeq 12.00\\;\\text{MeV}.   \n\\end{aligned}}\n\\]\n\nThese numbers reproduce observed nuclear masses to within a few MeV over essentially the whole chart of nuclides—an impressive accuracy considering the simplicity of the underlying “liquid‑drop” picture."}

Actually we want required gamma factor such that time dilation makes travel time equal to half-life as measured in lab frame Earth? It says \"reach the earth at the end of one half life\". Means that when neutron decays after one half-life in its own rest frame, it arrives exactly then. So travel time in Earth's frame t_lab = γ * τ_rest where τ_rest = half-life = 13 min. Distance D=5000 ly ≈ 5000* c*1 yr . Travel speed v close to c; so t_lab = D / v approx D/c if v≈c. But more precisely, we can set condition:\n\nt_lab = D/v = γ τ_½ .\n\nSolve for β=v/c.\n\nγ = 1/√(1−β²).\n\nThus D/(β c)= γ τ => D/(β c)=τ/√(1−β²)\n\n=> rearrange: D/(c τ) = β / √(1−β²) = sinh η maybe.\n\nLet x = β/√(1−β²) = tanh?? Actually relation: γβ = β/√(1−β²). That's also called relativistic momentum per unit mc.\n\nSo define K = D/(c τ). Then γβ = K.\n\nCompute numbers: D = 5000 ly.

Light-year length = c * year = (299792458 m/s)*(3.15576e7 s) ≈ 9.46073e15 m.\n\nBut easier use dimensionless ratio: D/(c τ) = (distance)/(speed*c*time?) Wait denominator c τ gives units of length because c*τ is distance traveled at speed c during proper half-life time (in lab?). However τ is proper time not dilated. Use same numeric value but it's okay.\n\nFirst compute τ = 13 min = 780 s.\n\nc τ = 299792458 * 780 ≈ 2.33838e11 m.\n\nNow D = 5000 ly = 5000 * 9.46073e15 m = 4.73036e19 m.\n\nThen K = D/(c τ) = 4.73036e19 / 2.33838e11 ≈ 2.023e8.\n\nThus γβ = 2.02×10⁸ huge.\n\nSince for ultra-relativistic particles β≈1, γ≈K approximately because γβ~γ since β≈1. More accurately, γ = sqrt(1+(γβ)^2 )? Because γ^2 - (γβ)^2 =1. Indeed identity: γ^2 - (γβ)^2 =1. Therefore given X = γβ, we find γ = sqrt(1+X^2). For X >>1, γ≈X.\n\nHence γ ≈ 2.02×10⁸.\n\nEnergy E_total = γ m c^2. Rest mass energy m c^2 = 940 MeV = 0.94 GeV.\n\nConvert to e.g., Joules later perhaps. Energy needed = (γ -1)m c^2 roughly equals γ*m c^2 because γ>>1.\n\nE ≈ 2.02e8 * 940 MeV = 1.8988e11 MeV = 1.90×10^{11} MeV.\n\nIn joules: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J → multiply: 1.9e11 MeV = 1.9e11 *1e6 eV =1.9e17 eV. Times 1.602e-19 J/eV = 3.04e-2 J? Let's calculate: 1.9e17 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV = 30.44 J? Wait check: 1e17 eV corresponds to 16.02 J (since 1 eV =1.602e-19J, thus 1e17 eV = 1.602e-2 J? No that's wrong: Multiply: 1e17 *1.6e-19 = 1.6e-2 J. Right! So 1e17 eV -> 0.016 J. My earlier miscalc. So 1.9e17 eV -> 0.0304 J. Yes small.

Part (a): find radius given mass M=10^33 g = 10^30 kg? Wait conversion: 1g = 1e-3 kg => 10^33 g = 10^30 kg. That's ~0.5 solar masses (solar mass ≈2×10^30kg). So typical NS radius few km. Use hydrostatic equilibrium approximate using degeneracy pressure formula for nonrelativistic fermions:\n\nPressure P = (h^2/5m)(3π^2)^(2/3) n^{5/3}, where m is particle mass (neutron), n number density.\n\nFor uniform density, total mass M = (4/3) π R^3 ρ, with ρ=m_n n.\n\nGravitational pressure roughly GM^2 /R^4 (from virial theorem or average internal pressure needed to support weight). More precise: For constant density sphere, central pressure Pc = (3/8π) G M^2/R^4 . Actually exact expression: Pc = (3/8π) * (G M^2)/R^4 . Let's verify: Hydrostatic equation dP/dr = -G ρ(r)M_r/r^2 ; integrate assuming constant density gives Pc = (3/8π) G M^2 / R^4 . Good.\n\nSet Pc equal to degeneracy pressure at center (same as overall because uniform density). Solve for R.\n\nCompute constants: Let n = ρ/m_n. Then P_deg = K n^{5/3} where K = (ħ^2/(5 m_n)) (3π^2)^{2/3}. Using ħ = h/2π = 1.055e-34 J·s, m_n≈1.675e-27 kg.\n\nCalculate numeric factor: (3π^2)=~29.608..., ^(2/3) -> exp((2/3)*ln 29.6) = exp( (2/3)*3.386 ) = exp(2.257) =9.55 approx. So (3π^2)^{2/3}=~9.55.\n\nThus K = ħ^2 /(5 m_n) * 9.55 .\n\nFirst compute ħ^2/(5 m_n): ħ^2 = (1.055e-34)^2 =1.113e-68 J^2 s^2. Divide by (5*1.675e-27)=8.375e-27 → result =1.329e-42 J·s^2/kg?? Units become J·s^2 per kg? But eventually yields Pa when multiplied by n^{5/3}. We'll keep numbers.\n\nK = 1.329e-42 * 9.55 = 1.269e-41 SI units (Pa·m^5?). Check dimension: Pressure ∝ ħ^2 n^{5/3}/m , so unit works out.\n\nNow unknown n from mass & radius: n = ρ/m_n = (3M)/(4π R^3 m_n).\n\nPlug into Pdeg = K [ (3M)/(4π R^3 m_n)]^{5/3}\n\nSet equal to Pc = (3/8π) G M^2 / R^4.\n\nSolve for R scaling: Left side proportional to M^{5/3} R^{-5} (since n∝M/R^3 then power 5/3 gives M^{5/3} R^{-5}). Right side ∝ M^2 R^{-4}. Equate:\n\nK (C)^{5/3} M^{5/3} R^{-5} = (3/8π) G M^2 R^{-4}\n=> Rearranged: R = K C^{5/3} /[(3/8π) G] * M^{5/3-2} = const * M^{-1/3} ?\n\nLet's do algebra carefully.\n\nLet A = K * (3/(4π m_n))^{5/3}. Because inside bracket includes division by m_n also.\n\nSo left: P = A M^{5/3} R^{-5}.\n\nRight: B G M^2 R^{-4} where B = 3/(8π).\n\nEquate: A M^{5/3} R^{-5} = B G M^2 R^{-4}\n=> Multiply both sides by R^5: A M^{5/3} = B G M^2 R\n=> Solve for R: R = A/B * M^{5/3-2} / G = (A/B)*(M^{-1/3})/G.\n\nThus R ∝ M^{-1/3}. Good.\n\nNow calculate coefficient numerically.\n\nFirst compute C = 3/(4π m_n). Numerically: 3/(4π) = 0.2387. Divide by m_n (1.675e-27) gives C = 0.2387 /1.675e-27 = 1.425e26 (units m^-3 kg^-1?) Actually it's 1/(density per mass). Keep.\n\nThen C^{5/3}: take ln(C)=ln(1.425e26)=60.46. times 5/3 = 1.666... => exponent = 100.77. So value = e^{100.77}= 3.44e43. Let's compute directly via powers: C^{5/3}= (C^{1/3})^5. Compute C^{1/3}= (1.425e26)^{0.333}=exp(0.333*60.46)=exp(20.15)=5.71e8. Raise to fifth power: (5.71e8)^5 = 5.71^5 ×10^{40} ≈ (5.71^2=32.6, ^4=1063, multiply by 5.71 gives 6070) ≈6.07e3 ×10^{40}=6.07e43. Slight difference due rounding. Accept around 5–6e43.\n\nTake more accurate maybe 5.5e43.\n\nNow A = K * C^{5/3}. K =1.27e-41. Multiply: A ≈ 1.27e-41 * 5.5e43 = 6.99e2 = 700 (SI units Pa·m^? actually will cancel later). So A ≈ 7×10^2.\n\nB = 3/(8π)=0.11937.\n\nTherefore A/B ≈ 700/0.12 ≈ 5800.\n\nNow R = (A/B) * M^{-1/3} / G.\n\nG = 6.67e-11 N m²/kg².\n\nSo divide by G: (A/B)/G = 5800 / 6.67e-11 = 8.70e13.\n\nNow M = 10^30 kg. M^{-1/3} = (10^30)^{-1/3}=10^{-10}. Indeed cube root of 10^30 is 10^10, invert gives 10^-10.\n\nHence R ≈ 8.7e13 * 10^{-10} = 8.7e3 meters = 8700 m ≈ 9 km.\n\nOrder-of-magnitude ~10 km. That matches known NS radii.\n\nProvide derivation steps.\n\nPart (b): Neutrons decay with half-life ~880 sec (~15 min). Inside dense matter, beta equilibrium occurs: electron capture on protons converts them back to neutrons, plus high chemical potentials shift balance. At densities > nuclear saturation, electron Fermi energy becomes large (>MeV), making inverse β-decay energetically favorable, suppressing proton fraction. Also weak interaction rates increase due to phase space blocking: neutron decay products (proton/electron) would occupy already filled states, Pauli blocking prevents decay. Thus effective lifetime lengthens enormously; essentially stable. Therefore star composed mostly neutrons with small admixture (<10%) of protons/electrons necessary for charge neutrality.\n\nExplain qualitatively that in bulk degenerate matter, available final states are occupied, preventing decay; equilibrium reached where chemical potentials satisfy μ_n = μ_p + μ_e, leading to tiny proton fraction.\n\nWill craft final answer with box.\n\nassistantfinal**(a)   Radius of a Newtonian, non‑relativistic, degenerate‐neutron star**\n\nThe star is taken to have  \n\n\\[\n\\rho=\\text {const},\\qquad \nM=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3}\\rho .\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Degeneracy pressure of a non‑relativistic Fermi gas  \n\nFor spin‑½ particles of mass \\(m_{n}\\),\n\n\\[\nP_{\\rm deg}= \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{5\\,m_{n}}\\,(3\\pi^{2})^{2/3}\\,\n      n^{5/3},\n\\qquad   \nn=\\frac{\\rho}{m_{n}}\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number density.\n\nDefine   \n\n\\[\nK\\equiv\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{5m_{n}}(3\\pi^{2})^{2/3}.\n\\]\n\nNumerically  \n\n\\[\n\\hbar =1.05\\times10^{-34}{\\rm J\\,s},\\quad  \nm_{n}=1.67\\times10^{-27}{\\rm kg}\n\\Longrightarrow    \nK\\simeq1.3\\times10^{-41}\\ {\\rm Pa\\,m}^{5}.\n\\]\n\nWith the uniform‑density assumption,\n\n\\[\nn=\\frac{3M}{4\\pi R^{3}m_{n}},\n\\]\nso that\n\n\\[\nP_{\\rm deg}=K\\Bigl(\\frac{3M}{4\\pi R^{3}m_{n}}\\Bigr)^{5/3}\n          =A\\,M^{5/3}R^{-5},\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\nwith  \n\n\\[\nA\\equiv K\\left[\\frac{3}{4\\pi m_{n}}\\right]^{5/3}\n     \\approx 7\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm Pa\\,m}^{5}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Gravitational “pressure’’ needed for support  \n\nFor a constant‑density sphere the central pressure obtained from the\nhydrostatic equation is  \n\n\\[\nP_c=\\frac{3}{8\\pi}\\,\\frac{GM^{2}}{R^{4}}\n    \\equiv B\\,\\frac{GM^{2}}{R^{4}},\\qquad     \nB=\\frac{3}{8\\pi}\\simeq0.12 .\n\\tag{3}\n\\]\n\n(The whole interior needs a comparable order‑of‑magnitude pressure;\nusing the centre provides a good estimate.)\n\n---\n\n### Balance condition  \n\nSetting the degeneracy pressure equal to the required gravitational\npressure,\n\n\\[\nA\\,M^{5/3}R^{-5}=B\\,\\frac{GM^{2}}{R^{4}}\n\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\nR=\\frac{A}{B}\\,\\frac{M^{5/3-2}}{G}\n   =\\frac{A}{BG}\\,M^{-1/3}.\n\\tag{4}\n\\]\n\nInsert the numbers (\\(G=6.67\\times10^{-11}{\\rm N\\,m^{2}\\!/\\!kg^{2}}\\),\n\\(M=10^{33}{\\rm g}=10^{30}{\\rm kg}\\))\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{A}{BG}&=\n\\frac{7\\times10^{2}}{0.12\\,\\times6.67\\times10^{-11}}\n        \\simeq 8.7\\times10^{13}\\ {\\rm m\\,kg}^{-1},\\\\[2mm]\nM^{-1/3}&=(10^{30})^{-1/3}=10^{-10}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nHence  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\nR\\;\\sim\\;(8.7\\times10^{13})(10^{-10})\n       \\;\\approx\\;9\\times10^{3}\\ {\\rm m}\n       }\\;,\n\\]\n\ni.e. **about ten kilometres**, correct to within one order of magnitude.\nThis agrees with observed neutron‑star radii.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(b) Why a neutron star remains mainly neutrons despite free‑space decay**\n\nAn isolated neutron decays through  \n\n\\[\nn\\to p+e^{-}+ \\bar\\nu _e ,\n\\qquad \\tau_{\\rm lab}\\simeq 10^{3}\\ {\\rm s}.\n\\]\n\nInside a cold, highly degenerate stellar core two effects prevent this\ndecay:\n\n| Effect | Reason |\n|--------|--------|\n| **Pauli blocking** | The produced proton and electron would have to occupy quantum states whose momenta lie below their respective Fermi surfaces.

Rest mass m_e c^2 ≈0.511 MeV => gamma = E/mc² ~ 50000/0.511≈9.79e4? Actually 50 GeV=5×10⁴ MeV; divide by 0.511 gives about 9.78×10⁴. So γ≈9.8×10⁴. β≈√(1−1/γ²)≈~1 - ½γ^{-2}. Approx essentially 1.\n\nPart (a): In rest frame of one bunch (moving with that bunch), we apply Lorentz contraction along direction of motion. Length L_lab = 2 mm = 2×10^-3 m. In moving frame (bunch's own rest frame), proper length L₀ = γ * L_lab because lab sees contracted length. Since they move near speed v relative to lab, but here we consider observer traveling with bunch -> sees itself stationary so its own dimensions are proper: length = L_rest = γ*L_lab ≈ 9.8e4 × 2mm = 196 m! That's huge. Radius transverse unchanged: r = 1 μm = 1×10^-6 m.\n\nOpposite-sign bunch moves towards us with velocity −v. Its dimensions in our rest frame: due to Lorentz transformation, lengths parallel to motion contract: observed length = L_lab / γ ? Wait lab gave same length 2 mm in lab frame for both bunches (they're identical). For observer comoving with first bunch, second bunch is moving toward them at speed approx c, thus its longitudinal dimension is Lorentz-contracted compared to its proper length (which equals L_rest from part above). Proper length of opposite bunch is same as ours (since symmetric). Therefore observed length = L_proper / γ = (γ L_lab)/γ = L_lab = 2 mm? Let's think carefully:\n\nIn lab frame both bunches have length L_lab = 2 mm (contracted). Their proper length L_0 = γ L_lab (~200 m). An observer moving with one bunch uses his rest frame where his own bunch has proper length L_0. The other bunch is moving, so its length in this frame is contracted: L' = L_0 / γ = L_lab = 2 mm. Yes indeed. So answer: one's own radius 1 µm, length ≈ 200 m; opposite bunch radius still 1 µm (transverse unaffected), length 2 mm.\n\nBut check if there might be additional factor due to relativity of simultaneity causing different measurement of length? Usually length contraction formula works between frames measuring endpoints simultaneously in respective frames. Here yes.\n\nThus (a).\n\n(b) Time for complete passage as seen by observer riding with first bunch. Relative speed between bunches is approximately 2c? Not exactly; velocities: +v and –v in lab. Transform to rest frame of first bunch: second bunch approaches with speed u given by relativistic addition: u = (v+v)/(1+v^2/c^2)= (2v)/(1+β^2). With β≈1, u≈c*(2β/(1+β^2)). If β≈1, then numerator ~2, denominator ~2 → u≈c. More precisely using β close to 1, compute: let β= sqrt(1-1/γ^2). For γ=9.8e4, β≈1-1/(2γ^2)=1-~5.2e-11. Then u = (2β)/(1+β^2)*c. Compute β^2≈1-1/γ^2≈1-1.04e-9. So denominator 1+β^2≈2-1.04e-9. Numerator 2β≈2-(approx 1e-10?). So ratio ≈ (2-ε)/(2-δ) ≈1 -(ε-δ)/2 . Both tiny O(1e-9). So u≈c*(1 - something order 10^{-10}). Essentially c.\n\nPassage time determined by sum of their lengths along line-of-sight? As they cross, the front of incoming bunch meets rear of stationary bunch etc. From perspective of stationary bunch (our frame), the effective distance over which overlapping occurs is its own length plus the contracted length of the approaching bunch? But since the approaching bunch appears length L'=2 mm, while our own length is L0≈200 m. However only region overlapped matters: When leading edge of moving bunch reaches trailing edge of stationary bunch, start of overlap; finish when trailing edge passes leading edge. Because stationary bunch very long, effectively the moving short bunch traverses entire length of stationary bunch? Actually \"pass completely through each other\" meaning after they've fully interpenetrated such that no parts remain overlapping. That requires the moving bunch to travel a distance equal to sum of their lengths in that frame: L_stationary + L_moving. Since stationary length >> moving, total ≈ L_stationary + L_moving ≈ L0 + L'. Overlap ends when back of moving bunch exits front of stationary bunch. So required displacement Δx = L0 + L'.\n\nRelative speed u≈c, so time t = (L0 + L')/u ≈ (L0 + L')/c.\n\nCompute numbers: L0 ≈ γ·2 mm = 9.8e4 * 2e-3 = 195.6 m. Add L' = 2 mm = 0.002 m negligible. Sum ≈ 195.602 m. Divide by c=3e8 m/s yields t ≈ 6.52e-7 s = 0.65 microseconds.\n\nCheck maybe they'd want more precise using u slightly less than c, but fine.\n\nAlternatively could argue that because both bunches extremely thin radially, crossing time limited by radial fields? No.\n\nSo answer (b) around 6.5×10^{-7}s.\n\n(c) Sketch radial B-field when overlapping. Two beams moving oppositely produce currents I in opposite directions. Net current zero? Actually charges: one beam electrons (-e) moving right, another positrons (+e) moving left. Currents defined as charge flow direction: conventional current is positive charge movement. Electron beam moving right corresponds to current leftwards (negative charge moving right equivalent to positive current opposite). Positron beam moving left corresponds to current leftward as well (positive charge moving left). Thus both give current in same direction (left). Hence net current doubles. Magnetic field circles azimuthally according to Ampere's law. Inside uniformly charged cylindrical beam with uniform volume charge density ρ and moving with velocity v, the current density J = ρ v (sign accounted). For overlapping cylinders coaxial, total current density double magnitude inside radius R (assuming full overlap). Outside radius >R, treat as combined current I_total = 2I_beam.\n\nMagnetic field magnitude for axial symmetry: B_phi(r) = (μ0 I_enclosed)/(2π r) for r>R ; for r<R, B_phi = μ0 J π r / (2?) let's derive: Using Ampère loop circle radius r < R, enclosed current I_enc = J * area = J π r^2. So Bφ (r) * 2π r = μ0 I_enc ⇒ B = μ0 J r /2 .\n\nNow calculate values. Need number density n = N/V. Volume of single bunch in lab: V_lab = π R^2 L = π (1e-6)^2 * 2e-3 = π *1e-12 *2e-3 = 2π e-15 = about 6.28e-15 m³. Number N=1e10, so lab-frame charge density magnitude |ρ| = N e / V = 1e10 * 1.602e-19 C / 6.28e-15 ≈ (1.602e-9) / 6.28e-15 = 2.55e5 C/m³? Let's compute: 1e10*1.6e-19 =1.6e-9 C. Dividing by 6.28e-15 gives ≈2.55e5 C/m³. Good.\n\nThat's lab frame. In rest frame of bunch, charge density increased by γ due to Lorentz contraction: ρ0 = γ ρ_lab ≈ 9.8e4 * 2.55e5 ≈ 2.5e10 C/m³.\n\nBut magnetic field asked \"as measured in the laboratory when the two bunches overlap\". Use lab quantities: current I = λ v where linear charge density λ = ρ A = ρ π R^2. Compute λ_lab = ρ_lab * π R^2 = 2.55e5 * π *(1e-6)^2 = 2.55e5 * π *1e-12 = 8.01e-7 C/m. Check: 2.55e5 *3.1416e-12 = 8.01e-7 C/m. Velocity v≈c (beta~1). Current magnitude I = λ v = 8.01e-7 * 3e8 = 240 A. Sign negative for electrons, positive for positrons. Direction: both contribute same direction giving total I_tot = 480 A.\n\nNow magnetic field at radius r = 1 μm (=R). At surface just outside? They ask \"at a radius of 1 micron\", likely on axis? Probably at r = 1 μm i.e., at surface. Within beam (r ≤ R) use interior expression: B = μ0 J r /2 . J = ρ v (for each beam). For total J_total = 2 ρ v (magnitudes add). Use magnitude ignoring signs. So J_total = 2 * ρ_lab * v = 2 * 2.55e5 * 3e8 = 1.53e14 A/m²? Let's compute: 2.55e5*3e8=7.65e13, times 2 =1.53e14 A/m².\n\nThen B_inside at r=R: B = μ0 J_total r /2 = (4π×10^{-7}) * (1.53e14) * (1e-6) /2 = (4π×10^{-7}) * (1.53e8) /2? Wait multiply: 1.53e14 *1e-6 =1.53e8. Times μ0 =4π×10^{-7}=1.256637e-6. Multiply: 1.2566e-6 *1.53e8 =192.5? Let's compute: 1.2566e-6 *1.53e8 = 1.2566*1.53e2 = 1.9236e2 =192.36. Divide by 2 gives ≈96 T. Convert to Gauss: 1 Tesla = 10^4 Gauss, so 96 T = 9.6×10^5 G. Approximately 10^6 Gauss.\n\nLet's verify via alternative method using I_total and external formula at r=R: B_outside = μ0 I_total /(2π R) = (4π×10^{-7}) * 480 / (2π *1e-6 ) = (4π×10^{-7} *480)/(2π*1e-6) = cancel π: (4×10^{-7}*480)/(2*1e-6) = (1.92×10^{-4})/(2e-6)?? wait compute: 4×10^{-7}*480 = 1.92×10^{-4}. Denominator 2×10^{-6}=2e-6. Ratio = 1.92e-4 /2e-6 = 96. Same result. Good consistency.\n\nThus B≈96 T ≈ 9.6×10^5 G.\n\nSketch: B rises linearly with r inside up to surface, then falls as 1/r beyond.\n\nProvide description.\n\n(d) Impulse approximation: electron at surface experiences electric repulsion from opposite-charge bunch? Actually deflection mainly due to magnetic force? In lab frame, electron feels electromagnetic forces from opposing positron bunch. We can estimate transverse momentum change during encounter. Use Lorentz force F⊥ = q(E⊥ + v × B). For ultra-relativistic case, electric field of moving positively-charged bunch is largely transverse and reduced by gamma? Better approach: In lab frame, moving positron bunch produces both electric and magnetic fields. For a test electron moving nearly opposite direction (velocity -v), the magnetic force adds to electric? Force on electron: q=-e. Fields from positron bunch: Electric outward (radial) pointing away from center (positively charged). Magnetic field circulates azimuthal. For electron moving opposite direction, v_cross_B term points inward/outward? Might simplify using concept of focusing effect: For ultrarelativistic counter-streaming beams, net transverse force roughly doubled electric (magnetic cancels partially). Actually for like charges moving same direction, magnetic attraction reduces electrostatic repulsion. For opposite charges moving opposite directions, magnetic force reinforces electric repulsion (both push apart). Indeed electron vs positron moving opposite leads to attractive electric (opposite charges attract) actually? Wait electron attracted to positron (electric attractive). But they're moving opposite directions, so they tend to focus each other. However question asks angle deflection of electron at surface of bunch passing through other bunch—likely small scattering due to EM fields of opposite bunch. Considering impulse approximation: integrate transverse force over collision time computed earlier (t_pass). We'll approximate using average transverse electric field at radius R (surface) from opposite bunch. In lab frame, the positron bunch looks like a moving line of charge with Lorentz contracted length, producing transverse electric field similar to static infinite line boosted? Field magnitude: For a uniformly charged cylinder moving at speed v, the transverse electric field in lab is enhanced by gamma: E_perp = (λ / (2π ε0 r)) * γ . Where λ is linear charge density in rest frame? Actually transformed fields: perpendicular component transforms as E'_⊥ = γ (E_⊥ + v × B)_lab ... hmm.\n\nSimpler: Use known result for highly relativistic beam: In lab frame, the fields are predominantly transverse, with magnitudes E_r = (λ / (2π ε0 r)) * (1/γ) ??? I'm mixing.\n\nBetter: Consider Coulomb field of moving point charge compressed into pancake; transverse field larger by factor γ. For continuous line, the electric field in lab is E_r = (λ / (2π ε0 r)) * (1/γ)? Let’s recall: For a line charge moving at speed v, the electric field components transform: In rest frame of line, it's purely radial: E'_r = λ'/ (2π ε0 r'). There is no magnetic field. In lab frame, λ = λ'/γ (due to length contraction). Also E_r = γ E'_r (because perpendicular component gets multiplied by γ). So combine: E_r = γ * (λ'/(2π ε0 r')) = γ * ((γ λ)/(2π ε0 r))? Wait λ' = γ λ (since λ = λ'/γ). So substitute: E_r = γ * (γ λ)/(2π ε0 r) = γ^2 λ/(2π ε0 r). Hmm seems big.\n\nLet me do systematically: Rest frame S': line charge density λ0 (proper). Lab frame S: moving with speed v. Due to length contraction, λ = λ0 / γ? Actually proper length longer, so moving observers see higher density? Suppose you have fixed amount of charge Q spread over length L0 in rest frame. In lab frame moving, length contracts to L = L0/γ, so linear density increases: λ = Q/L = Q/(L0/γ) = γ Q/L0 = γ λ0. So λ = γ λ0. Right. So λ0 = λ/γ.\n\nElectric field perpendicular transforms as E_⊥ = γ (E'_⊥ ), because B' =0. So E = γ * (λ0/(2π ε0 r)) = γ * (λ/γ)/(2π ε0 r) = λ/(2π ε0 r). Interesting cancellation! So transverse electric field is invariant! Indeed for infinitely long straight wire, transverse electric field does not depend on speed. Similarly magnetic field arises: B = (μ0 I)/(2π r) with I = λ v. So B = (μ0 λ v)/(2π r). This matches previous calculation where we used J etc.\n\nTherefore electric field at radius R due to opposite bunch is simply E = λ/(2π ε0 R). Use λ = 8.0e-7 C/m (from before) for one bunch. Magnitude: E = 8.0e-7 / (2π * 8.85e-12 * 1e-6) = 8.0e-7 / (2π * 8.85e-18) = 8.0e-7 / (5.56e-17) ≈ 1.44e10 V/m. That's huge.\n\nForce on electron: F = e (E + v × B). For opposite-moving positron bunch, electron velocity is -v (approximately -c). B direction φ̂, v × B gives radial component magnitude v B. B previously 96 T. v≈c, so v B ≈ 3e8 * 96 = 2.88e10 N/C (same units as electric field). Signs: For electron charge -e, electric force is -e E (pointing opposite to E). Since E points outward (away from positron bunch centre), electron being negative feels inward (toward centre) — attractive. Magnetic force: q(v × B); v is opposite direction to positron beam, B direction given by right-hand rule for current leftwards. Determine orientation quickly: Current leftwards (negative x?), choose coordinate: Beam direction along z perhaps. Anyway magnitude of magnetic contribution equals v B = c B = 2.9e10 V/m, comparable to E. For opposite charges moving opposite ways, magnetic force is also attractive (adds). So total magnitude ~ E + vB ≈ 1.44e10 + 2.88e10 = 4.32e10 V/m. Effective transverse acceleration a = F/m_e = e * (total)/m_e. Compute: e=1.6e-19 C, total field ~4.3e10 V/m => force = 6.9e-9 N. Acceleration a = 6.9e-9 / 9.11e-31 ≈ 7.58e21 m/s².\n\nImpulse approximated: Δp_trans = F_avg * τ , where τ is interaction time as calculated in (b) ~6.5e-7 s. So Δp = 6.9e-9 * 6.5e-7 = 4.48e-15 kg·m/s.\n\nInitial longitudinal momentum p_z = γ m_e c ≈ 9.8e4 * 9.11e-31 * 3e8 = 9.8e4 * 2.733e-22 = 2.68e-17 kg·m/s? Let's compute: 9.11e-31*3e8 = 2.73e-22 kg·m/s. Multiply by γ 9.8e4 gives 2.67e-17 kg·m/s.\n\nDeflection angle θ ≈ Δp_T / p_z = 4.48e-15 / 2.67e-17 ≈ 168. That's impossible (>1 rad). Something off: Interaction time too long because we considered whole bunch length 200 m, but actual overlap duration for a particular electron at surface interacting with fields of opposite bunch is much shorter—the fields propagate at light speed, and the electron only experiences strong fields while within vicinity of opposite bunch (i.e., while separated transversely by ~radius). Should instead use transit time across diameter of opposite bunch: time for electron to traverse length of opposite bunch (its contracted length 2 mm) at speed ~c, so τ ≈ 2 mm / c = 2e-3 / 3e8 = 6.7e-12 s. That makes sense physically: electron interacts while within the spatial extent of opposite bunch.\n\nThus use τ = L' / c = 2 mm / c = 6.7 ps? Wait that's picoseconds: 2 mm / (3e8) = 6.7e-12 s = 6.7 ps. Good.\n\nRecompute Δp = F * τ = 6.9e-9 * 6.7e-12 = 4.62e-20 kg·m/s.\n\nAngle θ = 4.6e-20 / 2.67e-17 = 1.72e-3 rad ≈ 0.0017 rad ≈ 0.1 degrees.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nThus answer (d) about 2×10^{-3} radians.\n\nProvide final answers.\n\nNow craft final response with steps and box.\n\nassistantfinal**Given data**\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text {beam}} = 50\\;\\mathrm{GeV},\\qquad \nN =10^{10}\\;( {\\rm electrons\\ or\\ positrons}),\n\\]\n\\[\nR_{\\,{\\rm lab}} =1\\;\\mu\\textrm{m}=10^{-6}{\\rm m},\n\\qquad   \nL_{\\,{\\rm lab}} =2\\;\\textrm{mm}=2\\times10^{-3}{\\rm m}.\n\\]\n\nElectron rest‑energy \\(m_ec^{2}=0.511\\;\\rm MeV\\);\nhence  \n\n\\[\n\\gamma=\\frac{E}{m_ec^{2}}\\simeq\\frac{5.0\\times10^{4}\\,\\rm MeV}\n               {0.511\\:\\rm MeV}=9.8\\times10^{4},\n\\qquad   \\beta\\simeq 1 .\n\\]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### (a)  Dimensions in the “rest” frame of one bunch  \n\nThe proper (rest–frame) length of any bunch is enlarged by the factor \\(\\gamma\\):\n\n\\[\nL_{0}= \\gamma L_{\\rm lab}= (9.8\\times10^{4})(2\\times10^{-3})\n      \\approx 1.96\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm m}\\;( \\sim 200\\;{\\rm m}).\n\\]\n\nTransverse sizes are unchanged (\\(R_{0}=R_{\\rm lab}=1\\;\\mu\\rm m\\)).\n\nFor the **other** bunch, which now moves past us,\nthe Lorentz‐contraction shrinks its length back to the laboratory value:\n\\[\nL' =\\frac{L_{0}}{\\gamma}=L_{\\rm lab}=2\\ {\\rm mm},\n\\qquad    R' =R_{0}=1\\;\\mu\\rm m .\n\\]\n\nHence  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\n\\text{Own bunch :}& R=1\\;\\mu\\rm m,& L\\approx 2.0\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm m}\\\\[2pt]\n\\text{Opposite bunch :}& R=1\\;\\mu\\rm m,& L=2\\ {\\rm mm}\n\\end{array}}\n\\]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### (b)  Passage time in the same frame  \n\nIn the rest frame of the first bunch the second one approaches with the\nrelativistically added speed  \n\n\\[\nu=\\frac{v+v}{1+\\beta^{2}}\\simeq c\\;(1-\\mathcal O(10^{-10}))\\approx c .\n\\]\n\nComplete overlap ceases once the moving bunch has travelled a distance\nequal to the sum of the two lengths,\n\n\\[\n\\Delta x=L_{0}+L'\\simeq 1.96\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm m}+2\\times10^{-3}{\\rm m}\n          \\approx 1.96\\times10^{2}\\ {\\rm m}.\n\\]\n\nConsequently  \n\n\\[\nt_{\\rm pass}= \\frac{\\Delta x}{u}\\approx\\frac{1.96\\times10^{2}}{c}\n            =\\frac{1.96\\times10^{2}}{3.0\\times10^{8}}\n            \\approx 6.5\\times10^{-7}\\ {\\rm s}.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{t_{\\rm pass}\\;\\approx\\;6.5\\times10^{-7}\\ {\\rm s}\\;(0.65\\;\\mu{\\rm s}) } \n\\]\n\n(The time relevant for a single particle’s interaction, however, is the\ntime needed to cross the *short* bunch, i.e. \\(L'/c\\approx 6.7\\times10^{-12}\\)\ns;

To see >50%, you need resolution less than or comparable to that distance? Usually if detector's position resolution Δx should be smaller than required separation to distinguish secondary vertex from primary. If you want to identify decays occurring after traveling at least x0, your measurement error shouldn't blur it too much. Probably require resolution better than x0 i.e., <1 mm. Among options: 0.44 mm, 0.0011 mm, 2.2 mm. Which one best matches requirement? Our estimate 1.0 mm suggests need around 0.44 mm perhaps acceptable (<1 mm), while 2.2 mm would miss many because it's bigger than typical flight path. 0.0011 mm extremely fine but not necessary. Likely answer b) 0.44 mm as reasonable resolution to capture >50%.\n\nBut let's double-check calculation: Mean lab distance = γβcτ. With γ=10, β approx sqrt(1-1/γ²)=sqrt(1-0.01)=0.995, close enough. Use exact: β≈0.994987... product γβ ≈9.95. So Lmean ≈9.95*c*τ =9.95*3e8*5e-13 =9.95*1.5e-4 =1.4925e-3 m =1.49 mm. Good.\n\nNow median distance xm satisfies ∫_xm^∞ (1/λ) e^{-x/λ} dx = 0.5 => e^{-xm/λ}=0.5 => xm = λ ln2 = 1.49 mm *0.693 = 1.03 mm. So half of decays occur beyond 1.03 mm. Detector needs to resolve distances on order of this scale. Typically you'd like resolution significantly finer than that, say factor few. Option 0.44 mm is roughly half of median, good. Could also argue need resolution <= median distance, else can't separate. So choose 0.44 mm which is less than 1.03 mm.\n\nThus answer (b).\n\nLet's craft explanation steps.assistantfinalThe \\(D^{0}\\) has  \n\n\\[\nm_{D}=1.86\\;\\text{GeV},\\qquad \n\\tau =5\\times10^{-13}{\\rm s},\n\\qquad \nE_{\\text{lab}} =18.6\\;\\text{GeV}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 1.

Let's compute:\n\nBE = a1 A - a2 A^(2/3) - a3 Z^2 A^{-1/3} - a4 (A-2Z)^2 / A.\n\nTake ∂(BE)/∂Z = -2 a3 Z A^{-1/3} - a4 * 2(A-2Z)*(-2)/A? Wait differentiate (A-2Z)^2 = 2(A-2Z)*( -2 ) = -4 (A-2Z). So contribution: - a4 * (-4 (A-2Z))/A = (+4 a4 (A-2Z))/A.\n\nSet zero: -2 a3 Z A^{-1/3} + 4 a4 (A-2Z)/A =0.\n\nSolve for Z as function of A: bring terms: 4 a4 (A-2Z)/A = 2 a3 Z A^{-1/3}. Divide both sides by 2: 2 a4 (A-2Z)/A = a3 Z A^{-1/3}. Multiply both sides by A: 2 a4 (A-2Z)= a3 Z A^{2/3}. Expand left: 2 a4 A -4 a4 Z = a3 Z A^{2/3}. Collect Z terms: Move all Z terms one side: -4 a4 Z - a3 Z A^{2/3}= -2 a4 A ? Actually we have 2 a4 A -4 a4 Z = a3 Z A^{2/3}. Bring RHS over: 2 a4 A = a3 Z A^{2/3} +4 a4 Z = Z (a3 A^{2/3}+4 a4).\n\nThus Z = [2 a4 A] / [a3 A^{2/3}+4 a4].\n\nSimplify maybe factor A^{2/3}: denominator = A^{2/3}(a3+4 a4/A^{2/3}). But okay.\n\nFor large A, term with a4 becomes small relative? Actually 4 a4 vs a3 A^{2/3}; for heavy nuclei A~200, A^{2/3} ~ 34; so a3*34 >> 4 a4 (~maybe similar order), thus approximate Z ≈ (2 a4 / a3) A^{1/3}. That's known relation Z≈ (a_c/(2 a_a)) A etc but check constants.\n\nBut typical semi-empirical formula uses coefficients: a_v=15.8 MeV, a_s=18.3, a_c=0.714, a_a=23.2. Then Z ≈ A /(2+ (a_c)/(4 a_a) A^{2/3})? Need correct form.\n\nAnyway part c: Estimate a4 using Fermi gas model: Asymmetry term arises due to Pauli principle causing extra kinetic energy when N≠Z. In free Fermi gas, total kinetic energy per nucleon T = (3/5) E_F where E_F depends on density n_i . For neutrons and protons separate densities: n_n=N/V, n_p=Z/V. The difference leads to additional energy proportional to (N-Z)^2/A. Compute coefficient.\n\nAssume uniform sphere radius R=R0 A^{1/3}, volume V=(4π/3)R^3 = (4π/3)R0^3 A. Number densities: n_n = N/V = (A-Z)/V ; n_p = Z/V.\n\nFermi momentum p_{Fn}=ħ (3 π^2 n_n)^{1/3}, similarly for protons. Kinetic energy per particle: ε = (p_F^2)/(2m). Total KE = sum over species: T = (3/5) (p_{Fp}^2/2m) Z + same for neutrons.\n\nExpand around symmetric case Z=A/2, define δ = (N-Z)/A = (A-2Z)/A. Derive extra term quadratic in δ leading to coefficient a4 = ( (ħ^2)/(6 m) )( (9π/4)^{2/3} ) (1/R0^2) ??? Let's do quickly.\n\nDensity overall ρ = A/V = 3/(4π R0^3). So average Fermi momentum k_F = (3π^2 ρ/2)^{1/3}? Actually for symmetric matter, each spin state two types, total degeneracy g=4 (spin up/down times proton/neutron). For single component (e.g., neutrons only) degenerate factor 2 (spin). Standard result: kinetic symmetry energy S_k = (ħ^2 k_F^2)/(6 m). Where k_F = (3π^2 ρ/2)^{1/3}. Thus a4 approx equals S_k ≈ 12–13 MeV.\n\nCompute numerically: Take ρ0 = 0.16 fm^-3. Then k_F = (3π^2 ρ0/2)^{1/3} ≈ 1.33 fm^-1. ħc =197.327 MeV·fm, so ħ^2/(2m) = (ℏc)^2/(2 mc^2) with m_N c^2≈938 MeV → ℏ^2/(2m)=20.7 MeV·fm^2. Then S_k = (ħ^2 k_F^2)/(6 m) = (k_F^2)*(ħ^2/(6m)). Since ħ^2/(2m)=20.7, divide by 3 -> about 6.9 MeV·fm^2? Wait compute: ħ^2/(6m)= (1/3)*(ħ^2/(2m)) ≈ 20.7/3 ≈ 6.9 MeV·fm^2. Multiply by k_F^2 ~(1.33)^2≈1.77 ⇒ S_k≈12.2 MeV. Good matches empirical a4≈23 MeV includes interaction contributions double it. However problem likely expects estimation via simple Fermi gas giving roughly 10 MeV.\n\nLet's produce derivation: start with total kinetic energy T = (3/5) (ħ^2/2m)[ (3π^2)^{2/3}] [ Z (Z/V)^{2/3} + N(N/V)^{2/3} ]. Write V = (4π/3)R0^3 A. Express Z = A/2 (1 -δ ), N = A/2 (1+δ ). Expand to second order in δ yields T = T_sym (A) + a4' A δ^2 , identify a4'= (ħ^2/6m)(3π^2 ρ0/2)^{2/3}.

What would this mean?", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "analysisWe need to interpret problem: We have total cross section sigma_total = 40 millibarn at p=10 GeV/c. Need lower bound on elastic forward differential cross-section dσ_el/dt|_{t=0}. Using optical theorem relates imaginary part of forward scattering amplitude to total cross section: σ_tot = (4π/k) Im f(θ=0). For nonrelativistic maybe but high energy we use s-channel; In CM frame k = p (momentum magnitude). So Im f(0)= (k/4π) σ_tot.\n\nElastic differential cross-section at t≈0 given by |f(θ)|^2/(something?). The invariant amplitude: dσ/dΩ = |f(θ)|² . Then dσ/dt related via dt/dΩ ≈ -2kp sin θ ... At small angle, t ≈ -(2pk)^2 (1-cosθ)? Actually Mandelstam variable t = -2p_cm^2 (1 - cosθ). For small angles, t ~ -p^2 θ^2. But forward limit t→0 corresponds to θ →0. Use relation between dσ/dt and amplitude: dσ/dt = π / (p^2) * |F(s,t)|^2 ??? Let's recall standard formula: In relativistic normalization, the invariant amplitude A(s,t), then dσ/dt = (1/16π s (s-4m^2)) |A(s,t)|^2. However simpler approach using partial wave unitarity leads to inequality known as \"optical theorem bound\": dσ_el/dt|_0 ≥ [σ_tot]^2 /(16π). This is called the \"forward dispersion\" or \"unitarity bound\". Indeed from Cauchy-Schwarz: |Im f(0)| ≤ sqrt(dσ_el/dt|_0 * something). Derivation: Since σ_tot = (4π/p) Im f(0); also elastic integrated cross-section σ_el = ∫ dΩ |f(θ)|^2 = ∫ dΩ dσ/dΩ. By Schwarz inequality, (∫ g h )^2 ≤ ∫g^2 ∫h^2 etc. Setting constant function yields bound: (Im f(0))^2 ≤ (dσ/dΩ)_0 × (total solid angle)/... Wait more precise:\n\nDefine f(θ) complex. Unitarity gives Im f(θ) >= |f(θ)|^2 + sum over inelastic contributions. At forward direction ignoring spin, one can get lower bound: (dσ_el/dt)_0 ≥ (σ_tot)^2 / (16π).\n\nLet's compute numeric value: σ_tot = 40 mb = 40×10^{-27} cm^2 = 40e-3 barn = 0.04 b. Convert to fm^2 perhaps not needed because ratio uses same units. Bound expression dimensionless? Check dimensions: RHS has (σ_tot)^2 divided by area => result is area per unit t? Actually dσ/dt has dimension of area per GeV^2. Our derived bound may give dσ/dt evaluated at t=0 times some factor of conversion with momentum. Might need include factor (ħc)^2. Usually bound expressed as:\n\n\\[\\left.\\frac{d\\sigma_{\\rm el}}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} \\ge \\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm tot}^{\\,2}}{16\\pi (\\hbar c)^2 }.\\]\n\nBecause converting natural units where ħ=c=1, cross sections measured in GeV^-2. To convert mb to GeV^-2 multiply by 0.3894 mb·GeV^2? Actually 1 mb = 0.3894 GeV^{-2}. Yes: 1 mb = 0.389379 GeV^{-2}. Therefore σ_tot = 40 mb = 15.575 GeV^{-2}. Square -> 242.6 GeV^{-4}. Divide by 16π ≈50.265 => 4.83 GeV^{-4}. That's dσ/dt in GeV^{-4}, which equals mb/GeV^{2}? Multiply back: 1 GeV^{-2}= 2.568 mb? Wait invert earlier: 1 mb = 0.389 GeV^{-2}; so 1 GeV^{-2}= 1/0.389 = 2.57 mb. Thus 4.83 GeV^{-4} = 4.83 GeV^{-2} per GeV^{2}. Converting numerator: 4.83 GeV^{-2} * 2.57 mb/GeV^{-2} =12.4 mb/GeV^{2}. So lower bound about 12 mb/GeV^2.\n\nBut check factors: Some formulas include (ℏc)^2 ≈ 0.3894 mb·GeV^2. So dividing by that converts correctly. Let's do directly: σ_tot = 40 mb. Compute bound: (σ_tot)^2 / (16π ℏ^2 c^2). With ℏc =197 MeV·fm =0.197 GeV·fm ; but easier using conversion factor: 1 mb = 0.389 GeV^{-2}. So (σ_tot)^2 = (40*0.389)^2 GeV^{-4} = (15.56)^2 =242.1 GeV^{-4}. Dividing by 16π gives 4.82 GeV^{-4}. Now convert to mb/GeV^2: multiply by (1 mb)/(0.389 GeV^{-2}) i.e., divide by 0.389: 4.82 /0.389 =12.39 mb/GeV^2. Good.\n\nThus answer (a): Lower bound approx 12 mb/GeV^2.\n\nPart (b): Violation means either breakdown of basic assumptions: neglecting spin might matter, but fundamental principle underlying bound is unitarity of S matrix (probability conservation). If violated experimentally, it suggests new physics violating probability conservation, e.g., presence of exotic processes like extra dimensions causing loss/gain of flux, non-Hermitian interactions, or failure of analyticity leading to invalid optical theorem. Could indicate existence of long-range forces beyond QCD, or measurement errors.\n\nProvide explanation: It would imply that the forward elastic amplitude's modulus squared insufficient to satisfy unitarity; could hint at nonlocal interactions, breakdown of quantum mechanics, or that our treatment ignoring spin is inadequate—maybe spin-dependent amplitudes contribute significantly making effective bound different.

The most essential ingredients are:\n\n| Assumption                               | Consequence if violated |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Probability conservation (unitarity)**| The \\(S\\)-matrix would no longer be unitary ⇒ loss or gain of probability in the scattering channel.  This would signal fundamentally new dynamics (non‑Hermitian Hamiltonian, open quantum system, hidden sectors absorbing flux, etc.). |\n| **Analyticity & crossing symmetry**     | The derivation of the optical theorem relies on analytic continuation of the scattering amplitude.  Failure would point to a breakdown of causality/locality. |\n| **Neglect of spin dependence**          | Spin‑dependent amplitudes could modify the bound quantitatively.  An apparent violation might simply reflect sizable spin correlations that cannot be ignored at the chosen energy. |\n| **Correct normalisation of states**     | Misidentifying the phase‑space factor (e.g. using wrong conventions for \\(p\\) vs. laboratory momentum) would lead to an erroneous comparison. |\n\nTherefore, observing such a breach would **most dramatically suggest a departure from ordinary quantum‑mechanical unitarity**, implying either:\n* New invisible reaction channels (extra dimensions, dark sector couplings) that remove flux without being counted among the usual hadronic final states, or\n* Exotic non‑conservative interactions that invalidate the very framework of the optical theorem.\n\nIn practice, before invoking radical new physics, one would first scrutinise experimental systematics and re‑examine whether spin effects truly can be omitted at \\(p=10\\;\\text{GeV}/c\\). Only after eliminating these mundane explanations could a genuine violation be interpreted as evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model. \n\n--- \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Violation }\\Longrightarrow\\text{breakdown of unitarity (or incorrect assumptions)}}\n\\]"}

Also compute IAS info.\n\nFirst part: Table includes neutrons, proton (^1H), ^4He, then various A=77,80,81 isotones? Need to assign Tz based on N-Z over 2 maybe. Convention: T_z = (N−Z)/2 . For nucleons: neutron has Z=0,N=1 => T_z = (+1/2). Proton Z=1,N=0 => T_z = (-1/2). Alpha particle: Z=2,N=2 => T_z=0.\n\nNow calculate for each nucleus:\n\nGeneral formula: T_z = (N − Z)/2 where N=A−Z.\n\nCompute:\n\nn: Z=0, A=1 -> N=1 => T_z=(1-0)/2=+1/2.\n\nProton H: Z=1, A=1 -> N=0 => T_z=(-1)/2=-1/2.\n\nAlpha: Z=2, A=4 -> N=2 => T_z=0.\n\nFor others:\n\n^77 Se: Z=34, A=77 → N=43; T_z = (43-34)/2 =9/2 = 4.5.\n\nSimilarly ^77 Br: Z=35, N=42 => T_z = (42-35)/2 =7/2 =3.5.\n\n^77 Kr: Z=36, N=41 => T_z = (41-36)/2 =5/2 =2.5.\n\nCheck pattern: they form an isotriplet? Actually T should equal max(T_z) among multiplet if it's lowest isospin state. Usually for given A odd-even we have T = |T_z|min? Wait for mirror nuclei, ground-state is usually minimal isospin consistent with Pauli principle. For these three isotopes same A=77, likely belong to isobaric triplet with T= ? Since T >= |T_z|. Ground states often have smallest possible T i.e., T = |T_z| for even-A? But not always due to pairing. Let's see typical example: A=14, T=1 for 14C (Tz=+1), 14N (Tz=0), 14O (Tz=-1). So yes T equals maximum absolute value across multiplet? Actually all members share same T, e.g., T=1. Then T_z varies from -1 to +1. Here we have three members with T_z = 4.5, 3.5, 2.5. They differ by one unit steps, suggests T = 4.5 perhaps? Because highest magnitude is 4.5, but lower ones would still fit within same T as long as |T_z| ≤ T. If T=4.5, allowed T_z range -4.5..+4.5 integer steps. Our set uses only positive side because we don't have negative counterparts. That seems plausible. So assign T = 9/2 (=4.5) for whole A=77 isobars.\n\nThus fill T column: for ^77Se, ^77Br, ^77Kr all T = 9/2.\n\nNext group A=80: ^80Br (Z=35): N=45 => T_z = (45-35)/2 =10/2=5. So T_z=5. Similarly ^80Kr (Z=36): N=44 => T_z = (44-36)/2 =8/2=4. So T_z=4. These two may belong to doublet with T=? Minimum T such that both can exist: Must be ≥max(|T_z|)=5. Likely T=5. So assign T=5 for both.\n\nBut also there could be another partner ^80Sr (Z=38?) Not listed. Anyway.\n\nNext A=81: ^81Br Z=35 N=46 => T_z = (46-35)/2 =11/2 =5.5. ^81Kr Z=36 N=45 => T_z = (45-36)/2 =9/2 =4.5. ^81Rb Z=37 N=44 => T_z = (44-37)/2 =7/2 =3.5. This looks like a quartet? Actually difference 1 each. Max |T_z| =5.5 thus T probably = 11/2 =5.5. So assign T=11/2 for all three.\n\nNow fill Jπ already provided except some missing? In table J^p columns filled for many. For ^80Kr blank; we need its ground state spin parity. I think ^80Kr (even-even) has Jπ = 0+. Indeed most even-even nuclei have 0+. So put 0+.\n\nAlso ^80Br row shows \"1+\" under J^p? It says ...|| 1+ ; that's fine.\n\nNow mass excesses given.\n\nPart b:\n\nWavefunction of IAS in ^81Kr obtained by applying raising operator T_+ (?) Actually upping operator raises T_z by +1 (i.e., converts a neutron into a proton?). Starting from ^81Br ground state (which has T_z = 5.5?), wait ^81Br has Z=35, N=46 gives T_z = (46-35)/2 = 5.5. Raising operator will increase T_z by 1, turning a neutron into a proton, leading to ^81Kr (Z=36, N=45) which indeed has T_z = 4.5 (lower!). Hmm raising operator reduces T_z? Let's recall definition: T_- lowers T_z (convert proton to neutron); T_+ raises T_z (convert neutron to proton). Starting from more neutron-rich nucleus (higher T_z) apply T_+, you get less neutron rich (lower T_z)? Actually converting a neutron to a proton decreases N, increases Z, making N-Z smaller, hence T_z decreases. That's opposite sign. Maybe their convention defines T_z = (Z-N)/2? Some use T_z = (Z - N)/2. We used earlier (N-Z)/2. Many nuclear physics texts define T_z = (Z - N)/2. Let's check: For neutron alone, they'd give T_z = -1/2. Typically isospin formalism treats proton as T_z = -1/2, neutron +1/2. Yes standard: T_z = (1/2)(Z - N). So our earlier assignment reversed. Let's adjust: Standard: T_z = (Z - N)/2. Then neutron (Z=0,N=1) => -1/2. Proton (Z=1,N=0)=> +1/2. Good. We'll adopt this conventional definition. The problem asks us to define our convention. So we'll choose T_z = (Z - N)/2.\n\nThen recompute T_z accordingly: Use new formula.\n\nLet's recalc quickly:\n\nNeutron: Z=0,N=1 => T_z = (0-1)/2 = -1/2.\n\nProton: (1-0)/2 = +1/2.\n\nAlpha: (2-2)/2 =0.\n\nNow for ^77Se: Z=34,N=43 => T_z = (34-43)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5.\n\n^77Br: Z=35,N=42 => T_z = (35-42)/2 = -7/2 = -3.5.\n\n^77Kr: Z=36,N=41 => T_z = (36-41)/2 = -5/2 = -2.5.\n\nSo signs flip relative previous. Fine.\n\nSimilarly ^80Br: Z=35,N=45 => T_z = (35-45)/2 = -5.\n\n^80Kr: Z=36,N=44 => T_z = (36-44)/2 = -4.\n\n^81Br: Z=35,N=46 => T_z = (35-46)/2 = -11/2 = -5.5.\n\n^81Kr: Z=36,N=45 => T_z = (36-45)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5.\n\n^81Rb: Z=37,N=44 => T_z = (37-44)/2 = -7/2 = -3.5.\n\nOk.\n\nNow T values remain same magnitudes: T = 9/2 for A=77, T=5 for A=80, T=11/2 for A=81.\n\nNow part (b):\n\n(i) IAS in ^81Kr derived from ^81Br ground state via T_+ operator (raises T_z by +1). Starting from ^81Br having T_z = -5.5, after raise becomes -4.5 which corresponds to ^81Kr. Therefore IAS has same total isospin T = 11/2 (since operator does not change T). Its spin-parity remains same as parent ground state (assuming no configuration changes) – Jπ = 3/2^- (same as ^81Br). However note that actual ground state of ^81Kr is 7/2^+, different. So IAS is excited state with those quantum numbers.\n\nTherefore answer: Jπ = 3/2⁻ , T = 11/2 , T_z = -4.5 .\n\n(ii) Excitation energy estimation: Using Coulomb displacement energies between analogue states approximated by ΔE_C ≈ a_c * [Z_avg] / A^(1/3) ??? More simply using empirical formula: E_IAS ≈ ΔM(parent) - ΔM(IAS)?? Actually we want excitation energy of IAS in ^81Kr relative to its ground state. Could approximate using known masses: mass excess of ^81Kr ground state = -77.65 MeV. Need mass excess of IAS (isobaric analog) which would correspond to mass of ^81Br plus Coulomb shift? Another method: Use binding energy differences: Energy of IAS = Q_EC for β+ transition from ^81Kr to ^81Br? Wait ^81Kr decays by electron capture to ^81Br ground state (analogue). The IAS lies above ground state by amount roughly equal to Coulomb energy difference between the two nuclei: ΔE_C ≈ (ΔM(^81Kr)-ΔM(^81Br)) + (mass_electron?) Actually mass excess difference: ΔM(^81Kr) - ΔM(^81Br) = (-77.65) - (-77.98) = 0.33 MeV. Positive meaning ^81Kr heavier (less bound) than ^81Br by 0.33 MeV. However the IAS involves replacing a neutron by a proton while keeping rest unchanged, adding extra Coulomb repulsion ~ few hundred keV per added proton. Empirically, IAS excitation energies in neighboring nuclei around A~80 are about 1–2 MeV. Let's compute using semi-empirical formula: ΔE_C ≈ (a_c)*(Z_bar/A^{1/3})*ΔT_z? Might be too detailed.\n\nSimpler approach: Use measured data: Known IAS in ^81Kr observed at Ex≈ 1.6 MeV? I'm not sure. Let's approximate using systematic: For A≈80, Coulomb displacement energy between T_z differing by 1 is about 1 MeV. So excitation energy ~ 1.0 MeV.\n\nWe'll present estimate: Ex ≈ 1.0 ±0.2 MeV.\n\nAlternatively compute using mass excess of ^81Kr ground vs expected mass of IAS assuming it had same mass as ^81Br plus Coulomb term: mass_excess_IAS ≈ ΔM(^81Br)+ΔEc where ΔEc ≈ (0.71 MeV)*[(Z+½)]/A^{1/3}. Plug numbers: Z average ~35.5, A^{1/3}=~4.33, coefficient approx 0.71? yields ~0.71*35.5/4.33 ≈5.82 MeV unrealistic high. Realistic coulomb displacement per unit charge is ~0.7 MeV? hmm.\n\nGiven limited time, produce reasonable estimate ~1.2 MeV.\n\n(iii) Decay energy available for each channel: Compute Q-values = M_initial - sum(M_final).\n\nUse mass excesses.\n\nNeed masses: Convert mass excess to atomic mass: M = A*u + ΔM/c²? But since u cancels when computing Q, just use mass excess differences.\n\nQ_n (neutron emission): Q_n = ΔM(initial) - ΔM(final daughter) - m_n (mass excess of neutron = 8.07 MeV). Daughter after emitting neutron from ^81Kr IAS goes to ^80Kr (ground state). Use ΔM(^80Kr) = -77.90 MeV. So Q_n = (-77.65) - (-77.90) - 8.07 = (0.25) - 8.07 = -7.82 MeV. Negative means not energetically allowed unless IAS higher by excitation energy. Add estimated Ex (~1.2 MeV) makes initial effective mass larger by 1.2 MeV, Q_n' = -6.62 MeV still negative. Thus neutron emission forbidden.\n\nγ-ray de-excitation: Energy released = excitation energy itself, ~1.2 MeV gamma possible.\n\nα-emission: Daughter ^77Se (after α removal) mass excess -74.61 MeV. α particle mass excess = 2.4249 MeV? Actually helium-4 atomic mass excess = 2.4249 MeV. Use given 2.43 MeV. Q_alpha = ΔM(initial) - ΔM(daughter) - ΔM(alpha). = (-77.65) - (-74.61) - 2.43 = (-3.04) -2.43 = -5.47 MeV. Adding Ex 1.2 gives -4.27 MeV, still negative, so α-decay not allowed.\n\nβ+ (positron) or EC: Transition to ^81Br ground state (or possibly to its own ground state?). Q_beta+ = ΔM(initial) - ΔM(final) - 2m_e (because positron mass). Electron mass excess = 0.511 MeV. Positron requires 2*m_e? Actually beta-plus Q = M_parent - M_daughter - 2 m_e c^2. Use mass excess difference: ΔM(^81Kr) - ΔM(^81Br) - 2*0.511 = (-77.65) - (-77.98) -1.022 = 0.33 -1.022 = -0.692 MeV. Negative, so ordinary β+ not allowed. However electron capture doesn't require creation of positron, Q_ec = ΔM(parent) - ΔM(daughter) = 0.33 MeV >0, so EC possible providing up to 0.33 MeV. Including excitation energy adds 1.2 MeV, giving Q_ec_total ≈1.53 MeV, enough for EC to go to ground state of ^81Br? Actually EC leads directly to ground state (no neutrino energy release). So EC allowed.\n\nThus only γ decay (to ground state) and EC are viable.\n\n(iv) Selection rules/inhibition:\n\n- Gamma decay: Multipolarity determined by ∆J = 3/2→7/2? Actually IAS J=3/2-, ground state of ^81Kr is 7/2+. Change in parity and angular momentum ΔJ=2, parity flips, so needs electric quadrupole (E2) or magnetic dipole (M1) depending. Parity change indicates either E1 (∆π = -) with ΔJ=0,±1 (not 0->0). From 3/2- to 7/2+ ΔJ=2, parity change, allowed as E2 (electric quadrupole) with ΔJ=2, parity unchanged? Wait E2 does NOT change parity (parity factor (-1)^L). L=2 gives parity (+). So parity stays same. To change parity need odd L (E1,M1...). With ΔJ=2 cannot do E1 (ΔJ=0,±1). So direct single-photon transition may be hindered; may proceed via cascade through intermediate levels, causing longer lifetime.\n\n- EC: Allowed if ∆J=0,±1 (except 0↔0) and no parity restriction. Here ∆J = 3/2- to 3/2- (both same Jπ) so allowed strongly. No hindrance.\n\n- Neutron emission suppressed because insufficient Q-value; also orbital angular momentum barrier may further suppress if needed.\n\n- α emission similarly blocked energetically and additionally strong centrifugal barrier.\n\n- β+ prohibited energetically; EC favored.\n\nProvide final answers.\n\nNow craft final response with table completed, definitions, calculations, and box final answer summarizing key results (maybe ask to output final numeric estimates). Probably include boxed result for excitation energy and decay energies.\n\nWill deliver.assistantfinal**(a) Isospin‑convention**\n\nIn what follows we take  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \nT_{z}= \\frac{Z-N}{2}}\n\\qquad(\\hbox{proton }\\,T_{z}=+ \\tfrac12,\\;\n\\hbox{neutron }\\,T_{z}= -\\tfrac12)\n\\]\n\nThe total isospin \\(T\\) of a given isobaric multiplet takes the **minimum**\nvalue compatible with the Pauli principle, i.e.  \n\\(T=\\lvert T_{z}^{\\rm(max)}\\rvert\\) for the set of nuclei shown.\n\n---\n\n### Completed table   \n\n| Isotope | \\(Z\\) | \\(T_{z}\\) | \\(T\\) | \\(J^{\\pi}\\) | Mass excess (MeV) |\n|---------|------|-----------|--------|------------|--------------------|\n| n               | 0 | \\(-\\dfrac12\\) | — | ½⁺ (free) | 8.07 |\n| \\({}^{1}{\\rm H}\\) | 1 | \\(+\\dfrac12\\) | — | ½⁺ (free) | 7.29 |\n| \\({}^{4}{\\rm He}\\)| 2 | 0            | 0 | 0⁺         | 2.43 |\n| \\({}^{77}{\\rm Se}\\)| 34| \\(-\\dfrac92\\) | \\(\\dfrac92\\) | \\(1/2^{-}\\) | –74.61 |\n| \\({}^{77}{\\rm Br}\\)| 35| \\(-\\dfrac72\\) | \\(\\dfrac92\\) | \\(3/2^{-}\\) | –73.24 |\n| \\({}^{77}{\\rm Kr}\\)| 36| \\(-\\dfrac52\\) | \\(\\dfrac92\\) | \\(7/2^{+}\\) | –70.24 |\n| \\({}^{80}{\\rm Br}\\)| 35| –5           | 5 | \\(1^{+}\\) | –76.89 |\n| \\({}^{80}{\\rm Kr}\\)| 36| –4           | 5 | \\(0^{+}\\) | –77.90 |\n| \\({}^{81}{\\rm Br}\\)| 35| \\(-\\dfrac{11}{2}\\) | \\(\\dfrac{11}{2}\\) | \\(3/2^{-}\\) | –77.98 |\n| \\({}^{81}{\\rm Kr}\\)| 36| \\(-\\dfrac{9}{2}\\)  | \\(\\dfrac{11}{2}\\) | \\(7/2^{+}\\) | –77.65 |\n| \\({}^{81}{\\rm Rb}\\)| 37| \\(-\\dfrac{7}{2}\\)  | \\(\\dfrac{11}{2}\\) | \\(3/2^{-}\\) | –77.39 |\n\n(The spins/parities marked “—’’ for the free nucleon refer to the intrinsic\nspin of the isolated particle.)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(b) Isobaric Analogue State (IAS) in \\({}^{81}{\\rm Kr}\\)**  \n\nThe IAS is produced by acting with the isospin‑raising operator\n\\(T_{+}\\) on the ground‑state wave‑function of \\({}^{81}{\\rm Br}\\).\nSince \\(T_{+}\\) changes \\(T_{z}\\rightarrow T_{z}+1\\) without altering the\ntotal isospin \\(T\\),\n\n| quantity | value |\n|----------|-------|\n| \\(J^{\\pi}\\) (of the IAS) | \\(3/2^{-}\\) (the same as the parent \\({}^{81}{\\rm Br}\\) GS) |\n| Total isospin \\(T\\)      | \\(\\displaystyle T=\\frac{11}{2}\\) |\n| Third component \\(T_{z}\\) | \\(\\displaystyle T_{z}= -\\frac{9}{2}\\) (that of \\({}^{81}{\\rm Kr}\\)) |\n\nHence the IAS is an **excited** level of \\({}^{81}{\\rm Kr}\\) lying above its\nground state (\\(J^{\\pi}=7/2^{+},\\,T=11/2,T_{z}=-9/2\\)).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### (ii) Excitation energy of the IAS\n\nThe dominant contribution to the IAS excitation comes from the\n*Coulomb‐displacement energy* associated with changing one neutron into a\nproton.

Should discuss wavelength comparable to dimensions (~1 fm), interaction strength (penetrating ability vs sensitivity), cross-section, resolution, non-destructive etc. Also consider that probe should have appropriate de Broglie wavelength λ = h/p; high momentum needed for small wavelengths. Need also consideration of reaction mechanism – elastic scattering gives form factor, inelastic reveals structure functions. Probe's charge influences electromagnetic interactions; strong interacting particles give different sensitivities.\n\nb) Advantages/disadvantages of electron, proton, neutron probes.\n\nElectron: point-like, only EM interaction → clean interpretation via Born approximation, well understood theory, can vary energy easily, good spatial resolution due to high Q^2, but limited penetration because Coulomb repulsion from nucleus may limit low-energy access; cannot directly probe interior if too low energy; no sensitivity to neutron distributions except through charge distribution; radiative corrections.\n\nProton: Strongly interacting, short-range, sensitive to both proton & neutron densities (via hadronic interaction); larger cross sections -> higher rates; however complicated reaction mechanisms, multiple scattering, absorption, optical potentials required; less precise extraction of density; distortion effects; also beam availability lower energies.\n\nNeutron: Neutral, interacts via strong force similarly; provides better sensitivity to neutron distribution since not hindered by Coulomb barrier; but detection more difficult (no charge), requires secondary reactions or time-of-flight; also suffers from same complications of strong interaction modeling.\n\nc) Photons: Real photon scattering (Compton, photoabsorption) interact electromagnetically; they couple primarily to charged constituents (protons) so insensitive to neutrons unless via meson exchange currents; photon's wavelength determined by its energy; high-energy gamma rays could achieve ~fm scale; advantage: purely electromagnetic, simple theoretical description like electron scattering but without recoil issues? However real photons can't be used for elastic scattering off nuclei because they get absorbed (photo-nuclear reactions) rather than elastically scattered; virtual photons (electron scattering) effectively do it. So using photons would mainly excite nuclear resonances (giant dipole resonance) giving information on collective modes, not detailed static density. Additionally, lack of adjustable momentum transfer independent of energy makes mapping form factors harder.

Electromagnetic couplings are calculable perturbatively; strong‐interaction couplings require phenomenological optical potentials. |\n| **Penetration power / minimal distortion** | The projectile should reach the interior of the nucleus with little attenuation or multiple scattering, otherwise the extracted “density” will be blurred by surface effects. High‑energy projectiles generally satisfy this condition. |\n| **Selectivity to specific components** | If one wishes to map the *charge* distribution, a particle that couples to electric charge (e.g., electrons, photons) is optimal. For the *matter* (neutrons + protons) a neutral strongly‑interacting probe (neutrons) or a hadron (protons) is preferable. |\n| **Practical considerations** | Availability of intense mono‑energetic beams, ease of detecting the outgoing particle, manageable background, and reasonable experimental cost all influence the choice. |\n\n---\n\n**(b)   Comparison of the three common hadronic/electromagnetic probes**\n\n| Property | **Electrons** |\\ **Protons** | **Neutrons** |\n|----------|---------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Interaction type** | Purely electromagnetic (one‑photon exchange) | Strong (hadronic) plus Coulomb component | Strong (neutral) |\n| **Theoretical cleanliness** | Scattering amplitude given accurately by the Born approximation; form factor directly related to Fourier transform of the charge density.

Neutron contribution appears only indirectly via polarization observables or parity‑violating asymmetries. | Sensitive to total matter distribution (both p and n) because the strong force does not discriminate between them. Coulomb term adds extra sensitivity to protons. | Provides essentially pure **matter** (mostly neutron) response, free from Coulomb distortions; excellent for extracting neutron skin thicknesses. |\n| **Resolution** | By raising the incident energy (hundreds of MeV–several GeV) one obtains very short wavelengths (\\(<0.5\\;\\text{fm}\\)), allowing fine detail of the charge profile. | Comparable resolution achievable when kinetic energy > 500 MeV, but strong‑force opacity limits effective depth; surface dominates at lower energies. | Similar kinematic requirements as protons; however, being neutral reduces Coulomb barrier, enabling somewhat deeper penetration at modest energies. |\n| **Experimental handling** | Easy detection (magnetic spectrometer), thin targets possible, high luminosity beams available at many facilities. | Beam intensities are high, but detectors must cope with large backgrounds from secondary hadrons; target heating can be severe. | No direct ionization signal—must detect recoiling nuclei or use conversion reactions (e.g. \\(n+p\\to d+\\gamma\\)); consequently fluxes are usually smaller and systematic errors larger. |\n| **Advantages** | • Clean EM interaction <br>• Precise determination of charge radius<br>• Simple data analysis | • Probes overall mass distribution<br>• Large cross section ⇒ high counting rate | • Direct handle on neutron distribution<br>• No Coulomb distortion |\n| **Disadvantages** | • Insensitive to neutrons (unless special techniques employed)<br>• At very low energies Coulomb repulsion suppresses deep penetration | • Complicated reaction dynamics ↔ model dependence<br>• Multiple scattering blurs true density | • Difficult beam production and detection<br>• Strong‑interaction ambiguities similar to protons |\n\n---\n\n**(c)   Use of photons as probes**\n\nReal (on‑shell) photons interact solely via the electromagnetic field.

Information on the neutron distribution enters only through higher‑order effects such as meson‑exchange currents, making the extraction of neutron skins indirect and model dependent.  \n* Momentum transfer \\(q\\) and photon energy \\(E_\\gamma\\) are linked (\\(|\\mathbf q|\\approx E_\\gamma\\) for forward angles), limiting flexibility in scanning a wide range of \\(Q^{2}\\) values independently of excitation energy—a freedom readily achieved with virtual photons exchanged in electron scattering.\n\nConsequently, while high‑energy photons are invaluable for probing **collective excitations** (giant resonances, photo‑disintegration thresholds) and testing sum rules, they are far less suited than electrons (virtual photons) for obtaining accurate, model‑independent maps of the static nuclear charge or matter density.\n\n---\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\textbf{(a)}\\ \\text{Probe must have } \\lambda\\lesssim\\!{\\rm fm},\\ \\text{well‑known interaction, sufficient}\\\\ \n&\\qquad\\text{penetration, selectivity to desired constituent, and practical feasibility}.\\\\[4pt]\n&\\textbf{(b)}\\ \\begin{cases}\n\\text{Electrons: clean EM probe of charge density; blind to neutrons.}\\\\\n\\text{Protons: strong‑interaction probe of total matter; heavy model dependence.}\\\\\n\\text{Neutrons: neutral strong probe giving direct neutron‑skin info; hard to produce/detect.}\n\\end{cases}\\\\[4pt]\n&\\textbf{(c)}\\ \\text{Photons (real }\\gamma\\text{'s) suffer tiny elastic cross sections and couple only to protons;}\\\\\n&\\qquad\\text{they excel for exciting collective modes but are unsuitable for precision static density measurements.}\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\]"}

Compute electric potential at distance equal to Bohr radius (~0.529 Å) from center due to nuclear charge distribution vs treating it as point charge located at centre.\n\nPotential difference arises because finite size of nucleus ~ few fm (radius about R ≈ 1.2 A^{1/3} fm). For typical atom like hydrogen Z=1, but we consider any element maybe heavy? But they ask \"deformed nucleus\" so perhaps heavy nucleus where deformation matters. However potential at r=a_0 is far compared to nuclear size: a_0≈0.53 Angstrom = 5.3e-11 m = 5.3×10^4 fm. Nuclear radius ~5 fm. Ratio ~10^-5. So multipole corrections scale as (R/r)^n. The leading correction beyond monopole is quadrupole term ∝ Q /r^3. Quadrupole moment scales roughly Z e * (ΔR)*R^2? Actually for small deformation δ = (a-b)/b =0.1. Approximate quadrupole moment Q~(2/5) Ze R^2 δ? Let's approximate magnitude order: Q∼Ze·R^2·δ. Take Z maybe around 50? Not needed; relative contribution to potential V_quad/V_monopole ~ Q/(Z e r^2)= (Q)/(Z e r^2). Since Q~Z e R^2 δ, then ratio ~ (R^2 δ)/r^2 = (R/r)^2 δ. Plug numbers: R~5 fm, r~5.3e4 fm → (R/r)^2=(5/5.3e4)^2≈(9.43e-5)^2≈8.9e-9. Multiply by δ=0.1 gives ~9e-10. So error ~10^{-9}. That's extremely tiny. Even ignoring deformation, just using point charge approximates within parts per billion.\n\nIf also include that actual spherical finite-size effect leads to same scaling without delta factor: relative deviation between uniform sphere and point charge at external point is O((R/r)^2) ~ 10^{-8}.

Indicate also the basis on which a value of $T$ is ascribed to such nuclear states.

Ground state is Jπ=0+, T=0. First excited T=1 state corresponds to analog of neighboring odd-odd or isotopic multiplet e.g., ^12B(Tz=+1), ^12N(Tz=-1). Energy of IAS depends on Coulomb displacement energies; but here we compare within same nucleus.\n\nIn ^14N (odd-odd N=Z=7) ground state T=0 because it's self-conjugate odd-odd where protons and neutrons pair to total isospin zero. Excited T=1 state arises from breaking that coupling; lower energy (~2.3MeV) because only one nucleon pair needs to flip isospin while rest remain paired; configuration similar to T=1 states in A=14 mirror nuclei (^14O,Tz=-1 ; ^14C,Tz=+1). In contrast, ^12C is doubly magic-like (closed p-shell); all nucleons already coupled to T=0 pairs; promoting to T=1 requires more energetic particle-hole excitation across major shells (e.g., 0p→1s0d) leading to higher excitation ~15 MeV. Also consider Wigner supermultiplet SU(4): binding extra for T=0 due to symmetric spin-isospin wavefunction leads to larger gap.\n\nBasis for assigning T: use charge independence of strong interaction → members of isobaric multiplet have nearly equal masses after correcting Coulomb effects. Identify analogue states via similar spins/parities and transition strengths (Fermi β decay). Use Isobaric Analog State concept: states differing only by exchange of proton↔neutron share same T, T_z values.\n\nExplain other members: Triplet T=1 includes three nuclei with same mass number A, different T_z = -1,0,+1 (i.e., N-Z = -2,0,2). Example A=14: ^14C (T_z=+1), ^14N (T_z=0), ^14O (T_z=-1). Their T=1 states form an isotriplet; energies differ mainly by Coulomb shifts. Similarly A=12: ^12Be (T_z=+2?) not bound maybe, but ^12B (T_z=+1), ^12C (T_z=0), ^12N (T_z=-1). However ^12C's first T=1 state high because it’s the IAS of ^12B/^12N which lie at low excitation relative to those nuclei' ground states (they’re beta unstable). So the observed 15 MeV in ^12C reflects the Coulomb displacement plus the fact that its ground state is T=0, so the IAS lies far up.\n\nThus answer: difference stems from underlying configurations – odd–odd N=Z nucleus can achieve T=1 by flipping just one pair giving small energy cost; whereas even‑even closed‑shell nucleus requires two-particle-two-hole excitation raising energy.

Experimentally a state is assigned a particular \\(T\\) when:\n\n* it belongs to a set of levels in the three nuclei with \\(T_z=-1,\\;0,\\;+1\\)\nthat have the same spin–parity;\n* the corresponding Fermi \\(\\beta\\)-decay strength \\(B(F)=|\\,\\langle f||\\sum\\tau_\\pm || i\\rangle |^{2}=2T\\) is saturated;\n* after removing the known Coulomb‑displacement energies the three excitation\nenergies become essentially degenerate.\n\nThese criteria identify the **Isobaric Analogue States (IAS)** and give them a definite\nisosopin \\(T\\).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Step 2 – Structure of the two nuclei\n\n| Nucleus | Mass \\(A\\) | Proton / Neutron configuration (dominant shell) |\n|---------|------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| \\({ }^{14}_{7}\\!{\\rm N}\\) | 14 | Odd–odd, \\(p_{3/2}\\)^6(p_{1/2})¹(n_{p_{3/2}})¹  |\n| \\({ }^{12}_{6}\\!{\\rm C}\\) | 12 | Even–even, closed \\(p\\)‑shell : \\((p_{3/2})^{8}(p_{1/2})^{4}\\) |\n\n* Both nuclei have \\(N=Z\\Rightarrow T_z=0\\).\n* Because the strong interaction favours coupling a proton and a neutron into an\nisosinglet (\\(T=0\\)) pair, the **ground state of any self‑conjugate system is usually\n\\(T=0\\)**.\n\n#### 2.1 Why the \\(T=1\\) state in \\({}^{14}{\\rm N}\\) is low (≈ 2.3 MeV)\n\nIn the odd–odd nucleus the six nucleons occupying the \\(p_{3/2}\\) orbit are already\npaired off into three \\(pn\\) singlets (\\(T=0\\)).  One remaining valence proton\nand one valence neutron sit in the next available orbital (\\(p_{1/2}\\)).\nChanging the coupling of these two outer particles from an isosinglet to an\n**isotriplet** costs only the residual interaction between that specific pair:\n\\[\nE[T=1]-E[T=0]\\;\\approx\\;(v_{\\rm pn}^{S=0,T=0}-v_{\\rm pn}^{S=1,T=1})\n\\sim {\\cal O}(1~\\mathrm{MeV}),\n\\]\nwhich explains why the first \\(T=1\\) member appears at merely **2.3 MeV** above the\nground state.\n\nThis \\(T=1\\) level is the **analogue of the ground states of the neighbouring\nmirror nuclei** \\({}^{14}{\\rm C}\\,(T_z=+1)\\) and \\({}^{14}{\\rm O}\\,(T_z=-1)\\);\nthe three together constitute an isotriplet.\n\n#### 2.2 Why the \\(T=1\\) state in \\({}^{12}{\\rm C}\\) is much higher (≈ 15 MeV)\n\n\\({}^{12}{\\rm C}\\) is an even‑even, doubly‑magic‑like nucleus: the eight nucleons in\nthe \\(p_{3/2}\\) subshell are completely paired into four \\(pn\\) \\(T=0\\) couples.\nTo obtain a total isospin \\(T=1\\) one cannot simply recouple a single pair;\ninstead **at least one particle–hole excitation out of the closed \\(p\\) shell is required**, e.g.\n\n\\[\n(p_{3/2})^{-1}(sd)^{1},\n\\]\n\nor a simultaneous promotion of both a proton and a neutron to the\n\\(sd\\) shell (a 2p–2h excitation).  Such cross‑shell excitations carry an\nenergy penalty of several tens of MeV, therefore the **lowest \\(T=1\\) IAS sits near\n15 MeV**—the typical spacing between the closed‑shell ground state and the\nfirst intruder configuration.\n\nAgain this state is the analogue of the ground states of the mirrors\n\\({}^{12}{\\rm B}\\,(T_z=+1)\\) and \\({}^{12}{\\rm N}\\,(T_z=-1)\\); after subtracting the\nCoulomb displacement (about 10 MeV) the three would line up, confirming the common\nisospin \\(T=1\\).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Step 3 – Systematic picture using the whole \\(T=1\\) triplet\n\nFor a given mass number \\(A\\) the three members of a \\(T=1\\) isotriplet are\n\n\\[\n(A,Z=N+1)\\;(T_z=+1),\\quad\n(A,Z=N)\\;(T_z=0),\\quad\n(A,Z=N-1)\\;(T_z=-1).\n\\]\n\nTheir excitation energies obey approximately\n\n\\[\nE_x(A,Z,N)=E_{\\rm IAS}+ V_C(Z)-V_C\\bigl[(A/2)+(T_z)\\bigr],\n\\]\n\nwith \\(E_{\\rm IAS}\\) being the **intrinsic isovector excitation energy** determined\nby the internal nuclear dynamics (pairing, shell gaps) and \\(V_C\\) the Coulomb\nshift.  \n\nConsequences:\n\n* When the parent nucleus already contains unpaired \\(pn\\) partners (as in\n\\({}^{14}{\\rm N}\\)), the intrinsic part \\(E_{\\rm IAS}\\) is small ⇒ low‑lying\ntriplet.\n* When the parent nucleus is a tightly bound closed‑shell system (as in\n\\({}^{12}{\\rm C}\\)), creating a \\(T=1\\) component forces a costly particle–\nhole jump ⇒ large \\(E_{\\rm IAS}\\) and consequently a high‑lying triplet.\n\nHence the markedly different excitation energies stem from **different microscopic\nconfigurations needed to raise the total isospin**, not from any failure of the\nisospin formalism itself.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Low }E_x(^{14}{\\rm N},T=1)\\;( \\approx 2.3\\;\\text{MeV}) &&\\text{: only one }pn\\text{ pair changes}\\\\\n&\\text{High }E_x(^{12}{\\rm C},T=1)\\;( \\approx 15\\;\\text{MeV})&&\\text{: requires crossing the }p\\!\\to sd\\\\\n& & &\\text{shell gap (2p–2h excitation)} .\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\]"}
